Coalgebra is a unifying framework for studying the behaviour of state-based systems. In coalgebra, a system is viewed as a black box where knowledge of the system's state can only be obtained by observing the external behaviour. In particular, two states s and t are considered equivalent if whenever we run the system starting in state s , the observed behaviour is the same as when we run the system in starting in state t . The type of observations and transitions in the external behaviour is specified by the system type. The theory of universal coalgebra provides general definitions of observable behaviour and bisimilarity that can be instantiated for concrete system types, as well as a powerful and fascinating reasoning principle called coinduction (a notion that is dual to the well known induction principle).",

Next, a number of fundamental notions such as language equivalence of automata, bisimilarity of processes, and determinisation of nondeterministic automata, will be treated coalgebraically. The coalgebraic framework will then be used to obtain generalisations of these constructions to other types of systems.",
