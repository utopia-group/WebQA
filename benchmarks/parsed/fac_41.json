My research attemps to advance the field of unsupervised clutsering in a number of directions.   First, motivated by the fact that objects in a data set maybe similar to each other in multiple different ways, and different clustering structures may exist in the same data. I am interested in exploratively examining data in different ways to produce different clusterings. Such clusterings can be sometimes combined to provide a more reliable view of the structure of the data via cluster ensemble methods , or other times examined individually as they may provide different insights ( non-redundant clustering ).",

Due to the inherent embiguous nature of the clustering task, in practice it is very useful to consider some user-provided side information such that a learning algorithm can seek to find a underlying clustering struture to that is most consistent with the side information. For example such information can be expressed in terms of pairwise constraints requiring some objects to be placed together or apart. I am interested in developing clustering techniques that can take into consideration richer forms of user constraints (e.g., comparative constraints involving multiple objects), and active learning frameworks that effectively acquire various form of user inputs without imposing heavy burden on the users.
