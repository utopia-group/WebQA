See this Google doc for detailed guidelines and a list of papers. The paper reviews can be done in pairs. Paper reviews that are done in pairs will be evaluated with a slightly higher bar, and they ideally should contain reviews for two closely-related papers and are allowed two additional pages. Appendix or references beyond the page limit are allowed, but you will not be graded based on them.   Instead of doing the paper review, with approval from the course staff on the project topic, you can do a final project. Please come to the Tengyu Ma or Yu Bai's office hours to request the approval by briefly describing the project plan. We don't encourage you to do the project unless you own research area is closely related to machine learning theory. The project can be done in pairs.
