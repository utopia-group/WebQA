The method synthesizes a rational vector addition system with resets (Q-VASR) that simulates the action of an input loop, and then uses the reachability relation of that Q-VASR to over-approximate the behavior of the loop. The key technical problem solved in this paper is to automatically synthesize a Q-VASR that is a best abstraction of a given loop in the sense that (1) it simulates the loop and (2) it is simulated by any other Q-VASR that simulates the loop. Since our loop summarization scheme is based on computing the exact reachability relation of a best abstraction of a loop, we can make theoretical guarantees about its behavior. Moreover, we show experimentally that the technique is precise and performant in practice.",

Our algorithm, MatchEmbeds, extends the bipartite matching approach to the general case by using it as the foundation of a backtracking search procedure. We show that MatchEmbeds outper- forms state-of-the-art SAT, CSP, and subgraph isomorphism solvers on difficult random instances and significantly improves the performance of a client model checker for multi-threaded programs.",

Our approach builds on classical techniques for analyzing the behavior of linear dynamical systems. It is well-known that a closed-form representation of the behavior of a linear dynamical system can always be expressed using algebraic numbers, but this approach can create formulas that present an obstacle for automated-reasoning tools. This paper characterizes when linear loops have closed forms in simpler theories that are more amenable to automated reasoning. The algorithms for computing closed forms described in the paper avoid the use of algebraic numbers, and produce closed forms expressed using polynomials and exponentials over rational numbers. We show that the logic for expressing closed forms is decidable, yielding decision procedures for verifying safety and termination of a class of numerical loops over rational numbers. We also show that the procedure for computing closed forms for this class of numerical loops can be usedxc to over-approximate the behavior of arbitrary numerical programs (with unrestricted control flow, non-deterministic assignments, and recursive procedures).",

While any choice yields a sound result, for many analyses the choice can have a drastic effect on the precision of the results obtained.

The fundamental challenge is to devise an effective method for analyzing the behavior of a loop given the results of analyzing its body. The key idea is to separate the problem into two: first we approximate the loop dynamics by an abstract machine, and then symbolically compute the reachability relation of the abstract machine.",

However, there is a gap between the capabilities of recurrence solvers and the needs of program analysis: (1) loop bodies are not merely systems of recurrence relations---they may contain conditional branches, nested loops, non-deterministic assignments, etc., and (2) a client program analyzer must be able to reason about the closed-form solutions produced by a recurrence solver (e.g., to prove assertions). This paper presents a method for generating non-linear invariants for general loops by analyzing recurrence relations. The key components are an abstract domain for reasoning about non-linear arithmetic, a semantics-based method for extracting recurrence relations from loop bodies, and a recurrence solver that avoids closed forms that involve complex or irrational numbers.",

A satisfiability game, described by a quantified formula, is played by two players that take turns instantiating quantifiers. The objective of each player is to prove (or disprove) satisfiability of the formula. A reachability game, described by a pair of formulas defining the legal moves of each player, is played by two players that take turns choosing positions---rational vectors of some fixed dimension. The objective of each player is to reach a position where the opposing player has no legal moves (or to play the game forever). We give a complete algorithm for synthesizing winning strategies for satisfiability games and a semi-algorithm for synthesizing winning strategies for reachability games.",

Transition formulas for loops are computed by extracting recurrence relations from a transition formula for the loop body and then computing their closed forms. Experimentation demonstrates that this method is competitive with leading verification techniques.",

It has a modular architecture, which is based on separating the invariant synthesis problem in two subtasks: (1) data dependence analysis, which is used to construct a data flow model of the program, and (2) interpretation of the data flow model over a (possibly infinite) abstract domain, which generates invariants. This separation of concerns allows researchers working on data dependence analysis and abstract domains to combine their efforts toward solving the challenging problem of static analysis for unbounded concurrency.",

In this paper we present Escher, an algorithm that interacts with the user via input-output examples to synthesize recursive programs. Escher is parameterized by the components that can be used in the program, thus providing a generic synthesis algorithm that can be instantiated to suit different domains. Escher adopts a novel search strategy through the space of programs that utilizes special datastructures for inferring conditionals and synthesizing recursive procedures.",

An inductive data flow graph accounts for a set of dependencies between program events, and therefore stands as a representation for the set of executions which give rise to these dependencies. By representing information about dependencies rather than control flow, inductive data flow graphs can yield very succinct proofs. Our strategy for verifying concurrent programs defers reasoning about control to the proof checking step, a purely combinatorial problem, thus avoiding the need to reason about data and control simultaneously.",
