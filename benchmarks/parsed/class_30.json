Over the last thirty years, a variety of languages with diverse features have been developed, expressive radically different perspectives of the idea of computation. CSE 130 and CSE 230 are an introduction to these different perspectives, the fundamental concepts of languages, and how modern language techniques and idioms can be used to engineer software systems. For this purpose, we shall focus on three different paradigms -- functional, object-oriented and logic programming as embodied in OCaml, Python and Prolog. CSE 230 will in addition cover advanced topics such a the Curry-Howard Isomorphism, Program verification, and Type systems.",
