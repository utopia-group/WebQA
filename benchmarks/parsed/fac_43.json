The compiler artifact is freely available and its verification rests on a new technique for decomposing proofs of concurrent value-dependent noninterference into a set of simpler proof obligations (see the paper for further details).",

Unlike for storage channels, we are not yet able to prove the absence of timing channels in systems, largely because many timing channels exploit the timing properties of hardware microarchitectural features, like caches, which are not even documented, so are very difficult to reason about formally. For this reason, these channels must be dealt with empirically. I have been involved in NICTA's Timing and Side Channels activity, where we pioneered new techniques for empirically measuring the effectiveness of various timing channel mitigation techniques for seL4 [ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) 2014 ].",

Much of my recent research has therefore focused on how to reduce the cost of verifying properties of systems software. One technique I have explored, in collaboration with Programming Languages researchers from UNSW (notably Gabi Keller) via NICTA's Cogent project, has been to write verified systems software in a Domain Specific Language (DSL). Cogent [International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP) 2016 ] is a programming language that is carefully designed to enable systems written in it to be cheaply proved correct. It is coupled with a verifying compiler [International Conference on Interactive Theorem Proving (ITP) 2016 ] that automatically proves that the compiled code implements the Cogent source semantics. In conjunction with my PhD students Sidney Amani and Liam O'Connor (co-supervised with Gabi Keller), my undergraduate thesis student Japheth Lim, and the rest of the Cogent team, we have used this technique to build and (partially) formally verify correct Linux file systems far more cheaply than e.g. the verification for the seL4 kernel [International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems (ASPLOS) 2016 ].",

But just as important is the inability of software engineering managers to be able to predict the costs (and associated benefits) of proving their software correct. Another of my recent research activities has been to investigate this question in the context of NICTA's Proof, Measurement and Estimation (PME) project. As part of this work, my PhD student Daniel Matichuk and I, in collaboration with Empirical Software Engineering researchers and NICTA'sPME team, explored the relationship between the size of a statement to be proved about a piece of software, and the amount of effort required to prove the statement (using as a proxy the number of lines required to write the proof, which we had already established [ACM/IEEE Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM) 2014 ] is strongly linearly related). To do so, we crunched historical data about the various seL4 proofs as well as some other large, publicly available software proofs. We established empirically for the first time [International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) 2015 ] that a consistent relationship exists here and that it is in fact quadratic. This work is the first step towards building a predictive model for estimating the level of effort required to verify a piece of software.",

The CDDC allows users to interact with both highly-classified and lower-classification networks from a single display (monitor), keyboard and mouse. Its design makes it far more secure than existing solutions while also offering much greater usability, showing that with clever design usability and security need not be in conflict. We are currently working on building and verifying an seL4-based implementation of the device, leveraging our current work on verified information flow security.",
