Each slack day is a 24-hour extension on the deadline. You have a budget of 8 slack days for the entire semester, which you may apply to any combination of problem sets, on either the beta deadline or final deadline or both. You can use at most 2 slack days for a given deadline; after 2 days, whatever is in your git repository is what we will use for grading.",
