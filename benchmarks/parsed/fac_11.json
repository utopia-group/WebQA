However, the performance bottleneck remains one of the most critical challenges of current blockchains. In the standard Nakamoto consensus, the performance is bottlenecked by the facts 1) that only one participant can win the competition and contribute to the blockchain, i.e., concurrent blocks are discarded as forks, and 2) that the slowness is essential to defend against adversaries. For example, Bitcoin generates one 1MB block every 10 minutes and can therefore only process 7 transactions per second. The insufficient throughput and long confirmation delay severely limit the adoptions of blockchain techniques, causing poor user experience, congested network, and skyrocketing transaction fees.",
