In this class, the students will be joining an international team coming from universities such as Stanford, U. of Tokyo, U. of Singapore, U. of Helsinki etc. Each team will be embedded with a prominent open source project (see http://tinyurl.com/6S194projects for next semester's projects) and your grade will be based on your contribution to the project.  Teams will be mentored by leaders from their open source project.  In 6.Spring 20194, you will learn about project management, how to extend and debug unfamiliar systems, coordinate a distributed team, use modern tools, apply open source as a business model.     Because this course is a global collaboration, we need to start forming the teams by early next week. We need to hear from you by 11:59PM on Sunday December 21st  ***THIS SUNDAY***.  The enrollment is limited, apply at http://tinyurl.com/6S194application.  As this class gets heavily oversubscribed, apply only if you are fully committed to take the class.",
