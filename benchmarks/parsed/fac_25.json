Please apply for the class with this form before Wedneday, March 25th. Because we are physically mailing kits, we ask that students do not shop CS107E, as we have no way of transferring the kit to another student. If you have any questions, please email me.",

Unfortunately, though, TinyOS programming is not a blockbuster topic, so the book is a bit pricier than I'd like. You can download the first half of the published version for free. The first half covers the basics: this version does not include advanced topics like asynchronous code, writing generics, or the hardware abstraction architecture. There's a short errata page.",
