However, I also spend a fair amount of time now thinking more generally about pleasant interfaces (e.g., hardware instruction sets, OS system-call interfaces, programming languages) and efficient implementations of hardware and software systems, including through tinkering with traditional boundaries between layers.",

I'm interested in recruiting students to contribute. I do sometimes hire postdocs, though most of my recruiting strategy is centered on students (PhD, master's, undergrad). Ideal candidates have strong backgrounds in both rigorous mathematical reasoning and software/hardware systems implementation. There tends to be a bad match with students who use the word \"theory\" to describe their interests within programming languages or formal methods, to the point where our PhD program generally won't admit those people (they'd be better-served elsewhere!). Current MIT students interested in working together should e-mail me, while for others I suggest following our normal PhD application process.",

The programming layer on top is meant to involve our Fiat system for automatic and correct-by-construction program derivation from specifications, which we are currently experimenting with using to generate code for practical network servers, a convenient domain for trying to make high-level programming more like relational-database programming but without the usual rough edges. Beneath the level of assembly language, we have work in the Kami project on modular hardware verification and verified compilation, where development is proceeding now jointly with industry, and where I'm especially interested in exploring alternative concurrency support in general-purpose processors. One of the cross-cutting focuses now is cryptography, including in our Fiat Cryptography project that centers on what is essentially a verified domain-specific compiler for finite-field arithmetic, which should soon be included in the build process for Google Chrome (to produce some of the code to validate SSL connections).",

Proceedings of the 11th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP 2006). September 2006. I report on an experience using the Coq proof assistant to develop a program verification tool with a machine-checkable proof of full correctness. The verifier is able to prove memory safety of x86 machine code programs compiled from code that uses algebraic datatypes. The tool's soundness theorem is expressed in terms of the bit-level semantics of x86 programs, so its correctness depends on very few assumptions. I take advantage of Coq's support for programming with dependent types and modules in the structure of my development. The approach is based on developing a library of reusable functors for transforming a verifier at one level of abstraction into a verifier at a lower level. Using this library, it's possible to prototype a verifier based on a new type system with a minimal amount of work, while obtaining a very strong soundness theorem about the final product.",

We propose a new technique in support of the construction of efficient Foundational Proof-Carrying Code systems. Instead of suggesting that pieces of mobile code come with proofs of their safety, we instead suggest that they come with executable verifiers that can attest to their safety, as in our previous work on the Open Verifier. However, in contrast to that previous work, here we do away with any runtime proof generation by these verifiers. Instead, we require that the verifier itself is proved sound. To support this, we present a novel technique for extracting proof obligations about ML programs. Using this approach, we are able to demonstrate the first foundational verification technique for Typed Assembly Language with performance comparable to that of the traditional, uncertified TAL type checker.",

We do this with a Kettle tactic for Coq that uses theory-specific reasoning to simplify goals based on automatically chosen case analyses, returning to the user as subgoals the cases it couldn't prove automatically. The process can then be repeated recursively, using Coq's tactical language as a very expressive extension of the matching strategies found in provers like Simplify.

A summary of my experiences developing a proof-generating TAL type checker within the Open Verifier framework. In the style of Foundational PCC, the soundness of this verifier and the proofs it generates is based on no assumptions about the TAL type system. This was one of the first projects to consider the runtime performance of Foundational PCC-style verification.",
