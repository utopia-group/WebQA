The role, scale, and nature of software that affects our lives is ever changing. The goal of my research is to develop tools and techniques to improve the reliability and performance of software systems. My current research aims to develop explainable and scalable program analysis—tools that I would have wanted while I was working in the industry. Furthermore, the nature of software engineering is changing, spurred by the adoption of practical machine-learning systems; this change requires exploring fundamentally new ways of developing, verifying, and deploying software.",
