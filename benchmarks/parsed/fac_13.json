This creates a great burden on programmers who must be experts in both their application domain and in the myriad system issues that affect power, energy, reliability, performance, and more. To alleviate this burden, I study ways to build self-aware computing systems that understand high-level goals and automatically adapt their behavior to meet those goals optimally. This is interdisciplinary work covering traditional areas, like operating systems and computer architecture, as well as new areas, like control theory and machine learning applied to computer system management and optimization.",
