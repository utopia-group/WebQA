I'm interested in building systems that learn to translate natural language descriptions (e.g., in English or Chinese) into programs (e.g., in Python or C++). Such systems would unlock the full power of computing to a much wider audience. A while back, I wrote a friendly introduction to natural language interfaces (XRDS magazine 2014) and a slightly more technical survey article on executable semantic parsing (CACM 2016). One idea we've explored is to \"naturalize\" a programming language gradually into a natural language (ACL 2017). One can also use natural language to describe classifiers directly rather than requiring labeled data (ACL 2018). The tension between the fuzziness of machine learning and the crispness of logic also fascinates me. On this note, we showed that neural networks can solve SAT problems with surprising accuracy despite not being told explicitly what a SAT problem is (ICLR 2019).",

For example, on the SQuAD reading comprehension dataset we created (EMNLP 2016), we showed that state-of-the-art systems, despite reaching human-level benchmark performance, are easily fooled by distracting sentences in a way that no human would be (EMNLP 2017). Given society's increasing reliance on machine learning, it is critical to build tools to make machine learning more reliable in the wild. We've worked on using influence functions to understand black-box models (ICML 2017), semidefinite programming to provide certificates a neural network is safe from a class of adversaries (NeurIPS 2018), and distributionally robust optimization to ensure the fairness of machine learning models over time (ICML 2018).",
