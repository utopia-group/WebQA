Several different models of languages are discussed, including dynamic, scripting (e.g., Ruby, Python) functional (e.g., OCaml, Haskell, Scheme), logical (e.g., Prolog), and concurrent/parallel (an aspect of many languages). Language features such as formal syntax, scoping and binding of variables, higher-order programming, typing and type polymorphism, and concurrent language features will be explored.",
