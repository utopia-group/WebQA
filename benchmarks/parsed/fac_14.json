For this work, he was awarded the prestigious ACM SIGSOFT Award in 2015. Also, he is a recipient of the prestigious National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award , which recognizes outstanding research and excellent education. Jones’s research contributions span the duration of his undergrad, professional, graduate, and professorial career. Throughout this time, Jones created tools and techniques for software analysis (static and dynamic), techniques to help manage test suites for safety-critical software systems, techniques to support several aspects of software debugging and comprehension, and has studied the ways that software behaves in order to better model and predict it. Jones received the PhD in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, advised by Professor Mary Jean Harrold. At UC Irvine, Jones leads the Spider Lab and advises PhD, Masters, and undergraduate students to study and improve software development and maintenance processes. Jones is a regular author and reviewer for top-tier research conferences (e.g., ICSE, FSE, ISSTA, ASE) and has co-organized events such as the 1st Working Conference on Software Visualization (VISSOFT) and the 10th Workshop on Dynamic Analysis (WODA).",

At a local level, Jones visited local-area high schools to advise students on their university options in computer-science and software-related fields. At a department level, Jones led the departmental admissions process for all graduate students in 2011–2012, served on this committee for four consecutive years, and also served on several other department committees. At the campus level, Jones was elected to serve as the Campus Faculty Senate Assembly Representative for the School of ICS. At the international professional level, Jones helped to organize various conferences; for example, he served as track program chair for the 1st Working Conference on Software Visualization (VISSOFT) in 2013, and he co-organized (serving the roles of general and program co-chair) the Workshop on Dynamic Analysis (WODA) in 2010. Also, Jones is repeatedly invited to serve on and reviews for program committees of several of the most-respected, top-tier international research conferences and journals for software engineering.",
