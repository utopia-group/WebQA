Family medicine is a medical specialty anchored firmly in the biological, clinical and behavioral sciences. We provide continuing, comprehensive healthcare for the individual while emphasizing the health of the family. Family medicine doctors, like us, provide care for men, women, children and infants - there is no age limit to the patients a family physician serves. There is no part of the body, no disease or condition excluded from the family physician's care. In every sense, today's family physician is what patients throughout history had in mind when they used the term \"doctor.\" Our primary commitment is to excellence in patient care, we accomplish this with the help of our front desk staff, nurses, and medical assistants",
