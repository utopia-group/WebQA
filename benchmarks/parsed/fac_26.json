Examples of such systems, which we call ensembles , include programmable sensor networks (where the network topology can change due to failures in the nodes or links) and modular robotics systems (whose physical configuration can be rearranged under program control). We extend Meld, a logic programming language that allows an ensemble to be viewed as a single computing system. In addition to proving some key properties of the language, we have also implemented a complete compiler for Meld. It generates code for TinyOS and for a Claytronics simulator. We have successfully written correct, efficient, and complex programs for ensembles containing over one million nodes.",

We extend Meld, a logic      programming language that allows an ensemble to be viewed as a      single computing system. In addition to proving some key      properties of the language, we have also implemented a complete      compiler for Meld. It generates code for TinyOS and for a      Claytronics simulator.

Traditionally,      critical path analysis has been applied to DAGs, and thus was      constrained to combinatorial sub-circuits. We formally define the      global critical path (GCP) and show how it can be constructed      using only local information that is automatically derived      directly from the circuit. We introduce a form of Production      Rules, which can accurately determine the GCP for a given input      vector, even for modules which exhibit choice and early      termination. \\par The GCP provides valuable insight into the      control behavior of the application, which help in formulating      new optimizations and re-formulating existing ones to use the GCP      knowledge.

The latency to access memory is often not statically predictable, which creates problems for scheduling operations dependent on memory reads. More fundamental is that dependences between accesses may not be statically provable (e.g., if the specification language permits pointers), which introduces memory-consistency problems. Addressing these issues with static scheduling results in overly conservative circuits, and thus, most state-of-the-art HLS tools limit memory systems to those that have predictable latencies and limit programmers to specifications that forbid arbitrary memory-reference patterns. A new HLS framework for the synthesis and optimization of memory accesses (SOMA) is presented. SOMA enables specifications to include arbitrary memory references (e.g., pointers) and allows the memory system to incorporate features that might cause the latency of a memory access to vary dynamically. This results in raising the level of abstraction in the input specification, enabling faster design times. SOMA synthesizes a memory access network (MAN) architecture that facilitates dynamic scheduling and ordering of memory accesses. The paper describes a basic MAN construction technique that illustrates how dynamic ordering helps in efficiently maintaining memory consistency and how dynamic scheduling helps alleviate the variable-latency problem. Then, it is shown how static analysis of the access patterns can be used to optimize the MAN. One optimization changes the MAN interconnect topology to increase concurrence. A second optimization reduces the synchronization overhead necessary to maintain memory consistency. Postlayout experiments demonstrate that SOMA’s application-specific MAN construction significantly improves power and performance for a range of benchmarks.",

SOMA synthesizes a memory access      network (MAN) architecture that facilitates dynamic scheduling      and ordering of memory accesses. The paper describes a basic MAN      construction technique that illustrates how dynamic ordering      helps in efficiently maintaining memory consistency and how      dynamic scheduling helps alleviate the variable-latency problem.      Then, it is shown how static analysis of the access patterns can      be used to optimize the MAN. One optimization changes the MAN      interconnect topology to increase concurrence. A second      optimization reduces the synchronization overhead necessary to      maintain memory consistency. Postlayout experiments demonstrate      that SOMA's application-specific MAN construction significantly      improves power and performance for a range of benchmarks.}},   keywords = {Asychronous Circuits, Spatial      Computing,Phoenix,Network-on-a-chip},   url = {http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~seth/papers/venkataramani-tcad06.pdf}, }",

This opens the possibility of constructing      nanoscale circuits and memories where active devices are just a      few nanometers square and wire pitches may be on the order of ten      nanometers. The features can be defined at this scale without      using photolithography. The available assembly techniques have      relatively high defect rates compared to conventional      lithographic integrated circuits and can only produce very      regular structures. Nonetheless, with proper memory organization,      it is reasonable to expect these technologies to provide memory      densities in excess of 10/sup 11/ b/cm/sup 2/ with modest active      power requirements under 0.6 W/Tb/s for random read operations.},   url = {http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~seth/papers/lincoln-tnano05.pdf},   journal = {IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology},   author = {DeHon, Andre and Goldstein, Seth Copen and Kuekes, Phil      and Lincoln, Patrick},   year = {2005},   month = {Mar},   volume = {4},   issue = {2},   pages = {215-228},   keywords = {Fault and Defect Tolerance, electronic nanotechnology,      memory density, memory organization, molecular electronics},   doi = {10.1109/TNANO.2004.837849}, }",

BitValue uses forward and backward dataflow analyses, generalizing constant-folding and dead-code detection at the bit-level. This algorithm enables compiler optimizations which target special processor architectures for computing on non-standard bitwidths. Using this algorithm we show that up to 31% of the computed bytes are thrown away (for programs from SpecINT95 and Mediabench). A compiler for reconfigurable hardware uses this algorithm to achieve substantial reductions (up to 20-fold) in the size of the synthesized circuits.",

BitValue uses forward and backward dataflow analyses,      generalizing constant-folding and dead-code detection at the      bit-level. This algorithm enables compiler optimizations which      target special processor architectures for computing on      non-standard bitwidths. Using this algorithm we show that up to      31\\% of the computed bytes are thrown away (for programs from      SpecINT95 and Mediabench). A compiler for reconfigurable hardware      uses this algorithm to achieve substantial reductions (up to      20-fold) in the size of the synthesized circuits.},   keywords = {Spatial Computing,Reconfigurable      Computing,Phoenix,PipeRench,CAD}, }",

We show that existing message passing multiprocessors have unnecessarily high communication costs. Research prototypes of message driven machines demonstrate low communication overhead, but poor processor cost/performance. We introduce a simple communication mechanism, Active Messages , show that it is intrinsic to both architectures, allows cost effective use of the hardware, and offers tremendous flexibility. Implementations on nCUBE/2 and CM-5 are described and evaluated using a split-phase shared-memory extension to C, Split-C . We further show that active messages are sufficient to implement the dynamically scheduled languages for which message driven machines were designed. With this mechanism, latency tolerance becomes a programming/compiling concern. Hardware support for active messages is desirable and we outline a range of enhancements to mainstream processors.",
