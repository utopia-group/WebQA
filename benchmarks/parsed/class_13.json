In the first part, we focus on the study of different approaches for specifying the semantics of programming languages. We will study operational semantics for specifying how programs compute and axiomatic semantics for verifying programs. We will apply these techniques to imperative, functional and object-oriented languages. A good reference for this part of the course is Glynn Winskel's book on The Formal Semantics of Programming Languages.",

We will start with the simply typed lambda calculus and then move on to more advanced features such as types for imperative features and exceptions, parametric polymorphism, existential types for use in abstraction and module systems, and dependent types. Good references for this part of the course are Benjamin Pierce's Types and Programming Languages (more accessible) and John Mitchell's Foundations for Programming Languages.",

None of these prerequisites are strictly necessary, and your desire to be exposed to this material is very important.",
