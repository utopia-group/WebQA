<h1>Call For Papers</h1>
<hr/>
<p><b>Please note that revisions for papers submitted to the 2019 Symposium need to be submitted to the <a href="https://oakland19.seclab.cs.ucsb.edu/">S&amp;P 2019 submission site</a>.</b></p>
<hr/>
<p>Since 1980 in Oakland, the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy has been the
premier forum for computer security research, presenting the latest
developments and bringing together researchers and practitioners. We solicit
previously unpublished papers offering novel research contributions in any
aspect of security or privacy. Papers may present advances in the theory,
design, implementation, analysis, verification, or empirical evaluation and
measurement of secure systems.</p>
<p>Topics of interest include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access control and authorization</li>
<li>Anonymity</li>
<li>Application security</li>
<li>Attacks and defenses</li>
<li>Authentication</li>
<li>Blockchains and distributed ledger security</li>
<li>Censorship resistance</li>
<li>Cloud security</li>
<li>Cyber physical systems security</li>
<li>Distributed systems security</li>
<li>Economics of security and privacy</li>
<li>Embedded systems security</li>
<li>Forensics</li>
<li>Hardware security</li>
<li>Intrusion detection and prevention</li>
<li>Malware and unwanted software</li>
<li>Mobile and Web security and privacy</li>
<li>Language-based security</li>
<li>Machine learning and AI security</li>
<li>Network and systems security</li>
<li>Privacy technologies and mechanisms</li>
<li>Protocol security</li>
<li>Secure information flow</li>
<li>Security and privacy for the Internet of Things</li>
<li>Security and privacy metrics</li>
<li>Security and privacy policies</li>
<li>Security architectures</li>
<li>Usable security and privacy</li>
<li>Trustworthy computing</li>
<li>Web security</li>
</ul>
<p>This topic list is not meant to be exhaustive; S&amp;P is interested in all
aspects of computer security and privacy. Papers without a clear application to
security or privacy, however, will be considered out of scope and may be
rejected without full review.</p>
<h3>Systematization of Knowledge Papers</h3>
<p>As in past years, we solicit systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers that
evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge, as such papers can
provide a high value to our community. Suitable papers are those that provide
an important new viewpoint on an established, major research area, support or
challenge long-held beliefs in such an area with compelling evidence, or
present a convincing, comprehensive new taxonomy of such an area. Survey papers
without such insights are not appropriate. Submissions will be distinguished by
the prefix âSoK:â in the title and a checkbox on the submission form. They will
be reviewed by the full PC and held to the same standards as traditional
research papers, but they will be accepted based on their treatment of existing
work and value to the community, and not based on any new research results they
may contain. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and included in
the proceedings.</p>
<h3>Ongoing Submissions</h3>
<p>To enhance the quality and timeliness of the scientific results presented as
part of the Symposium, and to improve the quality of our reviewing process,
IEEE S&amp;P now accepts paper submissions 12 times a year, on the first of
each month. The detailed process is as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>A rolling deadline occurs on the 1st of each month, at 3:00 PM (UTC-7, i.e.,
PDT). This deadline is strict and no extensions will be granted.</li>
<li>Within two months of submission, author notifications of
Accept/Revise/Reject decisions will be sent out.</li>
<li>Within one month of acceptance, all accepted papers must
submit a camera-ready copy incorporating reviewer feedback.
The papers will immediately be published, open access, in the
Computer Societyâs Digital Library, and they may be cited as âTo
appear in the IEEE Symposium on Security &amp; Privacy, May
20XXâ.</li>
<li>A limited number of papers will be invited to submit a
revision; such papers will receive a specific set of expectations
to be met by that revision.  Authors may take up to three
months from decision notification to produce a revised manuscript
and submit it as part of the standard deadline on the 1st of the
month.  Authors will receive decisions on revisions within one
month.  See below for additional details on the resubmission
procedure.</li>
<li>Rejected papers must wait for one year, from the date of
original submission, to resubmit to IEEE S&amp;P.

<ul>
<li>A paper will be judged to be a resubmit (as opposed to a
new submission) if the paper is from the same or similar authors,
and a reviewer could write a substantially similar summary of the
paper compared with the original submission.  As a rule of
thumb, if there is more than 40% overlap between the original
submission and the new paper, it will be considered a
resubmission.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>All papers <b>accepted</b> by February 1st, 2020, or that are submitted as a revision
by February 1st, 2020 and the revision is then accepted, will be
included in the proceedings of the symposium in May, 2020 and
invited to present their work.  Other papers will be included
in the 2021 proceedings.<br/>
<ul>
<li>As a result, for authors who anticipate using the full
three months to respond to a Revision decision, the final
submission deadline for possible inclusion in the 2020 proceedings
is September 1st, 2019.</li>
<li>For authors who anticipate using only one month to respond
to a Revision decision, the final submission deadline for possible
inclusion in the 2020 proceedings is November 1st, 2019.</li>
<li>The final submission deadline for possible
inclusion in the 2020 proceedings is December 1st, 2019, but only
for papers accepted without revision.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3>Revised Submissions</h3>
<p>As described above, some number of papers will receive a
Revise decision, rather than Accept or Reject.  This decision
will be accompanied by a detailed summary of the expectations for
the revision, in addition to the standard reviewer comments.
 Authors may take up to three months to prepare a revision,
which may include running additional experiments, improving the
paperâs presentation, or other such improvements.  Papers
meeting the expectations will typically be accepted. Those that do
not will be rejected. Only in exceptional circumstances will
additional revisions be requested.</p>
<p>Upon receiving a Revise decision, authors can choose to
withdraw their paper or not submit a revision within three months,
but they will be asked to not submit the same or similar work again
(following the same rules as for Rejected papers) for 1 year from
the date of the original submission.</p>
<p>Revised submissions should be submitted on the first of
the month, just as with new submissions.  Revisions must be
accompanied by a summary of the changes that were made.</p>
<h3>Submission Statistics</h3>
<p>Statistics on the submissions and decisions made thus far are available <a href="submissions.html">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Student Program Committee</h3>
<p>Following a successful model used at last yearâs conference, as well as other
premier technical conferences, some paper submissions will be reviewed by a
âshadow PCâ of students and junior researchers. For more information see
<a href="studentpc.html">
https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2020/studentpc.html</a>.</p>
<h1>Instructions for Paper Submission</h1>
<hr/>
<p>These instructions apply to both the research papers and
systematization of knowledge papers.</p>
<p>All submissions must be original work; the submitter must
clearly document any overlap with previously published or
simultaneously submitted papers from any of the authors. Failure to
point out and explain overlap will be grounds for rejection.
Simultaneous submission of the same paper to another venue with
proceedings or a journal is not allowed and will be grounds for
automatic rejection. Contact the program committee chairs if there
are questions about this policy.</p>
<h3>Anonymous Submission</h3>
<p>Papers must be submitted in a form suitable for anonymous
review: no author names or affiliations may appear on the title
page, and papers should avoid revealing their identity in the text.
When referring to your previous work, do so in the third person, as
though it were written by someone else. Only blind the reference
itself in the (unusual) case that a third-person reference is
infeasible. Publication as a technical report or in an online
repository does not constitute a violation of this policy. Contact
the program chairs if you have any questions. Papers that are not
properly anonymized may be rejected without review.</p>
<h3>Conflicts of Interest</h3>
<h4>Drawn from the ACM SIGMOD 2015 CFP</h4>
<p>During submission of a research paper, the submission site
will request information about conflicts of interest of the paper's
authors with program committee (PC) members. It is the full
responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify all and only
their potential conflict-of-interest PC members, according to the
following definition. A paper author has a conflict of interest with a PC member
when and only when one or more of the following conditions
holds:</p>
<ol>
<li>The PC member is a co-author of the paper.</li>
<li>The PC member has been a co-worker in the same company or university within
the past two years.

<ul>
<li>For student interns, the student is conflicted with their
supervisors and with members of the same research group.  If
the student no longer works for the organization, then they are not
conflicted with a PC member from the larger
organization.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The PC member has been a collaborator within the past two years.</li>
<li>The PC member is or was the author's primary thesis advisor, no matter how
long ago.</li>
<li>The author is or was the PC member's primary thesis advisor, no matter how
long ago.</li>
<li>The PC member is a relative or close personal friend of the author.</li>
</ol>
<p>For any other situation where the authors feel they have a
conflict with a PC member, they must explain the nature of the
conflict to the PC chairs, who will mark the conflict if
appropriate.  Papers with incorrect or incomplete conflict of
interest information as of the submission closing time are subject
to immediate rejection.</p>
<h3>Human Subjects and Ethical Considerations</h3>
<h4>Drawn from the USENIX Security 2016 CFP</h4>
<p>Submissions that describe experiments on human subjects,
that analyze data derived from human subjects (even anonymized
data), or that otherwise may put humans at risk should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disclose whether the research received an approval or waiver from each of
the authors' institutional ethics review boards (IRB) if applicable.</li>
<li>Discuss steps taken to ensure that participants and others who might have
been affected by an experiment were treated ethically and with respect. </li>
</ol>
<p>If the submission deals with vulnerabilities (e.g.,
software vulnerabilities in a given program or design weaknesses in
a hardware system), the authors need to discuss in detail the steps
they have taken or plan to take to address these vulnerabilities
(e.g., by disclosing vulnerabilities to the vendors). The same
applies if the submission deals with personal identifiable
information (PII) or other kinds of sensitive data. If a paper
raises significant ethical and legal concerns, it might be rejected
based on these concerns.</p>
<p>Contact the program co-chairs
<a href="mailto:sp20-pcchairs@ieee-security.org">sp20-pcchairs@ieee-security.org</a> if you have any
questions.</p>
<h3>Page Limit and Formatting</h3>
<p>Submitted papers may include up to 13 pages of text and up
to 5 pages for references and appendices, totalling no more than 18
pages. The same applies to camera-ready papers, although, at the PC
chairsâ discretion, additional pages may be allowed for references
and appendices. Reviewers are not required to read
appendices.</p>
<p>Papers must be formatted for US letter (not A4) size
paper. The text must be formatted in a two-column layout, with
columns no more than 9.5 in. tall and 3.5 in. wide. The text must
be in Times font, 10-point or larger, with 11-point or larger line
spacing. Authors are encouraged to use the IEEE conference
proceedings templates. LaTeX submissions should use IEEEtran.cls
version 1.8. All submissions will be automatically checked for
conformance to these requirements.  Failure to adhere to the
page limit and formatting requirements are grounds for rejection
without review.</p>
<h3>Reviews from Prior Submissions</h3>
<p>Authors may optionally submit a document (PDF or text) containing:</p>
<ol>
<li>the complete reviews they received from prior
submission(s) and</li>
<li>a page of up to 500 words documenting the improvements
made since the prior submission(s).</li>
</ol>
<p>Also starting this year, if a submission is derived in any
way from a submission submitted to another venue (conference,
journal, etc.) in the past twelve months, we require that the
authors provide the name of the most recent venue to which it was
submitted. This information will not be shared with
reviewers. It will only be used (1) for aggregate statistics
to understand the percent of resubmissions among the set of
submitted (and accepted) papers; (2) at the Chairsâ discretion, to
identify dual submissions and verify the accuracy of prior reviews
provided by authors regarding previously rejected
papers.</p>
<h3>Submission</h3>
<p>Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (.pdf).
Authors should pay special attention to unusual fonts, images, and
figures that might create problems for reviewers. Your document
should render correctly in Adobe Reader 9 and when printed in black
and white.</p>
<h3>Conference Submission Server</h3>
<p>Papers must be submitted at <a href="https://oakland20.seclab.cs.ucsb.edu">https://oakland20.seclab.cs.ucsb.edu</a>.</p>
<h3>Publication and Presentation</h3>
<p>Authors are responsible for obtaining appropriate
publication clearances. One of the authors of the accepted paper is
expected to present the paper at the conference.</p>
