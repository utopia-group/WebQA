<h4>Ad for a class next semester: 6.Spring 20194, Open Source Software Project Lab</h4>
<div xmlns:o="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" xmlns:v="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml" xmlns:x="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:excel">If you enjoyed building real applications in 6.170, then you
might also want to look into the latest iteration of a rather new
MIT class that connects students with real open-source
projects.  The announcement says the deadline for announcing
interest is yesterday, but probably there's still a chance to
get in.<br/>
<br/>
<pre wrap="" xml:space="preserve">
6.Spring 20194 Open Source Software Project Lab, a Lab-based class in large-scale software development, will be offered in the Spring.  In this class, the students will be joining an international team coming from universities such as Stanford, U. of Tokyo, U. of Singapore, U. of Helsinki etc. Each team will be embedded with a prominent open source project (see <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://tinyurl.com/6S194projects">http://tinyurl.com/6S194projects</a> for next semester's projects) and your grade will be based on your contribution to the project.  Teams will be mentored by leaders from their open source project.  In 6.Spring 20194, you will learn about project management, how to extend and debug unfamiliar systems, coordinate a distributed team, use modern tools, apply open source as a business model.     Because this course is a global collaboration, we need to start forming the teams by early next week. We need to hear from you by 11:59PM on Sunday December 21st  ***THIS SUNDAY***.  The enrollment is limited, apply at <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://tinyurl.com/6S194application">http://tinyurl.com/6S194application</a>.  As this class gets heavily oversubscribed, apply only if you are fully committed to take the class.

<h1>General Information</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>This is a class in software engineering, with an emphasis on
design. It focuses on building web applications and services
because of their prominence today. Not every software system is a
web app, but the lessons learned in this class apply more
broadly.</p>
<p>The class emphasizes how to write modular and elegant code, and
how to design an application. Design means clarifying goals,
inventing key concepts, and choosing how the application should
behave, in addition to structuring the internals. In our
experience, these external aspects of design are the most
important, the least well understood by MIT students, and the ones
that are hardest to acquire in most industrial settings.</p>
<p>Focusing on some aspects inevitably means deemphasizing others.
So while the class will teach the fundamentals of web application
architecture, and you will become proficient with a particular
collection of technologies, these technologies are not the subject
of the class. Likewise, quality assurance techniques, such as code
review, testing and verification, are not extensively covered.</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>By the end of this class, you will have developed skills in four
distinct competency areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Hacking:</strong>
<p>being able to build a working web application, which involves:
writing code fluently in several languages (eg, JavaScript, HTML
and CSS); becoming familiar and comfortable with using libraries
(such as JQuery), web frameworks (such as Node and Express),
databases (such as MongoDB) and browser tools (such as the Chrome
IDE); working with GitHub repositories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Robust coding:</strong>
<p>writing code that is well organized at a high level; exploiting
the best programming language features appropriately and avoiding
troublesome ones; applying sophisticated idioms (such as
functionals and closures) to structure code elegantly; using
modularization features to encapsulate data representations and
other design secrets, and to minimize repetition; defining clean
interfaces to decouple components; preventing security attacks by
using standard mitigations; including automatable unit tests in the
code base; writing succinct and helpful specifications; choosing
names and commenting judiciously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Design:</strong>
<p>analyzing problems to understand what the tricky aspects are;
focusing and prioritizing the goals of a software project;
constructing a conceptual design for a system that identifies the
key concepts and their relationships; developing an interaction
design using wireframes; identifying key design issues, and
analyzing their tradeoffs; selecting features for a minimal viable
product; designing a data model and transforming it into a database
schema.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Professionalism:</strong>
<p>constructing and delivering a slide presentation on your work;
collaborating with team members; making constructive critiques of
other students' work; ensuring a polished visual appearance and
clear organization in written work, slides and deployed
software.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Textbooks</h2>
<p>There is no required text. Here are some books that provide
useful background on JavaScript and node.js:</p>

<h2>Course Structure</h2>
<p>
<strong>Projects</strong>. There are weekly assignments for the
first half of term, grouped into four separate projects, of which
the first three are solo and the last is a team project. The second
half of term is spent on a larger team project. Teams will
generally have four members; you will be able to choose your
teammates, but may not work with the same teammate on both
projects.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<strong>Repositories</strong>. You'll keep all your work in
a GitHub repository, and you will receive grading comments from
your TAs on GitHub too. You are responsible for obtaining your own
repository. Free repositories are public by default. If you prefer
to make your repository private, you will need to pay the fee for
an upgrade.</p>
<p>
<strong>Lectures</strong>. There are two 80-minute lectures each
week, which will focus on fundamental concepts and exemplars.</p>
<p>
<strong>Quizzes</strong>. After each segment of the course
(typically lasting a week or two) there will be a short in-class
quiz consisting of around five multiple choice questions to test
your understanding of the lecture material.</p>
<p>
<strong>Recitations</strong>. Each student will attend one
50-minute recitation each week. Recitations are taught by teaching
assistants and focus on the basics of the various technologies you
will be using. You can choose which recitation to attend, and may
attend a different one each week.</p>
<p>
<strong>Office hours and labs</strong>. The TAs will be
available for office hours and lab hours each week at times that
will be posted on the Stellar front page. These are likely to
change in response to student demand, so be sure to check when you
make your plans for the week. Office hours are intended for
students who have a particular topic they want to discuss with a
TA; labs are intended to provide a place where several students and
TAs will be working so that you can get help as you need it. Labs
will likely be phased out as the term progresses once students
become familiar with the key technologies.</p>
<!--
<p><strong>Critiques</strong>. During the final project, in place of lectures, class time will be used for critiques of student work by other students. Details will be provided later about how this will work.
-->
<h2>Collaboration and Grading Policy</h2>
<p>
<strong>Individual projects</strong>. Your work on the solo
projects should be entirely your own, although you are encouraged
to ask TAs for advice in lab sessions and office hours, and to use
Piazza to obtain answers to questions from other students. This
policy is designed to ensure that all students come to grips with
the basic languages and technologies that they will need throughout
the course.</p>
<p>
<strong>Team projects</strong>. Team projects, of course,
encourage collaboration. You are encouraged to work together on all
aspects of the projects; you should ensure that every team member
is involved in all aspects of the project (design, coding and
documentation).</p>
<p>
<strong>Reuse of third-party material</strong>. You are free to
use any third-party code, whether as libraries or code fragments,
and to adopt any ideas you find online or in books, so long as it
is publicly available and appropriately cited (see the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/academicintegrity/writing-code.html">section
on code</a> in the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/academicintegrity">MIT handbook on
academic integrity</a> for details). You may not use work produced
by students in earlier offerings of this class. Obviously, you may
not reuse a complete solution to a project.</p>
<p>
<strong>Sanctions</strong>. If you violate the course
collaboration policy, for example by collaborating outside lab
sessions on individual projects, you can expect to be asked to drop
the class (or worse).</p>
<!--
<p><strong>Competency-based Grading</strong>. Your overall class grade will be determined as follows. We will maintain a separate grade for each of the skill areas described above (hacking, robust coding, design and professionalism). Your overall grade will be obtained by combining these four components and will roughly be the average of the four. Bear in mind, however, that a poor grade in one area will not necessarily balance out a better grade in another area. In particular, you should not expect to get an A if you excel only in the coding components.</p>

<p>Within each of the four areas, the work you do over the term will contribute to your grade in proportion to the amount of time allocated to it. For example, a week of implementation on an individual project will contribute to the hacking and robust coding component the same amount as a week of implementation on the final project.</p>

<p>If your final grade determined by this method Falls near the borderline between two grades, your participation in class and recitations, and your performance on the nanoquizzes, will be taken into account.
-->
<p>
<strong>Grading</strong>. Components of the class will be
weighted as follows: solo projects 30%, small team project 20%,
final project 35%, quizzes 10%, participation 5%. The participation
grade is a determined subjectively by the staff observing your
interactions in lecture, recitation and team mentoring sessions,
and your contributions to online forums such as Piazza. Your lowest
quiz grade will be dropped. For the assignments, the four
competency areas described above will account for these proportions
of your grade: hacking 30%, robust coding 30%, design 30%,
professionalism 10%.</p>
<p>
<strong>Lateness</strong>. Each student has four slack days that
can be distributed throughout the solo projects in any way. Slack
days may not be used for team projects. For each day that an
assignment is handed in late without a slack day, 10% of the total
assignment value is lost. Missed quizzes cannot be made up.
Extensions without penalty are given for (a) major illness, and (b)
other extraordinary circumstances; in both cases, a letter from a
doctor or dean is required. Note that trips, interviews, minor
illness, etc., are not grounds for extensions: this is what slack
days are for.</p>
<h2>Class Contract</h2>
<p>The teaching staff of the course will endeavor to:</p>
<ul>

<p>Support and encourage full participation of all students.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a student, by taking this course, you agree to endeavor
to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Attend all class sessions, and to participate
enthusiastically;</p>

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Advice</h2>
<p>
<strong>Open-ended projects.</strong> In each of the small
projects (prior to the final project), you'll be given an
outline of a problem to solve. In contrast to many of the
assignments you'll have done at MIT, these will not be
precisely specified. It'll be your job to figure out exactly
what the problem is! This is one of the most important things to
learn in being any kind of designer. You should take this aspect
very seriously, not only because it's important and fun, but
also because you'll save yourself a lot of time and effort if
you know what the problem is before you start trying to solve
it.</p>
<p>
<strong>Getting started early.</strong> We strongly recommend
that you get going on projects as soon as you can, so you can get
help from the teaching staff and from your colleagues using the
Piazza forum, and make good use of lab and office hours. A good
practice is to make a start early in the week, giving the project
enough time to give you a sense of what's involved and how much
work it's likely to be. Whatever you do, don't leave work
until the night of the deadline!</p>
<p>
<strong>Professionalism.</strong> Part of being professional is
presenting your work well. Use this class as an opportunity to
practice presenting your design and implementation work in a
professional way. So make sure your diagrams are neat; your writing
is succinct and grammatical; your text documents show good
typographic taste; your user interfaces are clean and stylish; and
