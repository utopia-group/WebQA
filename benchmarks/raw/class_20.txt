<h2 id="syllabus">Syllabus</h2>
<h3>Course Description</h3>
<p>
      In this class, you will learn basic principles of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) for the design and evaluation of software systems. Includes research methods for studying human-machine interactions and user interfaces; design strategies; software evaluation methods; and related guidelines and standards. PREREQS: Grad standing in CS or permission of instructor.
      </p>
<p>There will be no programming. However, a significant portion of your grade
      will be based on a <a href="Project/project.html">team project</a> Here are <a href="Project/patients.html">possible projects</a> to choose from.
      </p>
<h3>Class meeting times</h3>
<p>This class will meet an average of only 3 hours per week in the classroom, because the hands-on component will require significant meeting times with your teams as well.  </p>
<p>The class sessions will be drawn from <font color="red">Mondays, Wednesdays, <b>and Fridays, 12:00-1:50pm</b></font>.  So, that means your schedule needs to allow attending class on any of those times.</p>

The in-classroom sessions are shown on the <a href="#schedule-heading">Schedule below</a>.



      <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>
            At the completion of this course, students will be able to:
            </p><ol>
<li>Describe HCI design processes.</li>
<li>Discuss HCI design guidelines, their foundations, assumptions, advantages, and weaknesses.</li>
<li>Describe basics of human subjects research.</li>
<li>Complete a basic human subjects research certification form.</li>
<li>Design a user interface based on analysis of human capabilities and needs, and prepare a prototype system.</li>
<li>Evaluate user interfaces using a variety of HCI research methods.</li>
<li>Make an oral presentation that justifies design decisions. </li>
</ol>
<h3>How the course will be conducted, method of instruction</h3>
<p>We will run this class as an "HCI clinic".  You will act as the "HCI doctors" to apply your emerging skills to healing <a href="Project/patients.html">"HCI patients"</a> -- systems whose UIs probably need improvement.  Thus, it is a hands-on course.

      </p><p>
	To do this, you will
      be required to work on group projects (~4-person groups) and
      classwork (in addition to doing readings) outside of class
      time. This class will also be very interactive. Participation
      will count towards your final grade, and I want a healthy
      discussion in each class session.</p>
<p>You are responsible for having done the reading before attending class
      that day and be ready to participate in the discussion.
      I may not go over all the reading material in class, preferring
      to spend that time elaborating or discussing that material with you.
      This does not mean the assigned reading is not important, or will not
      be covered in a test.</p>
<h3>Grading</h3>
<p>I have high expectations.
      Thus, in this class, "A" does not mean
      "adequate" or "nothing really wrong": instead, it means "excellent". For an A, you
      should expect to work hard and get the most you can out of the class.</p>

Student performance will be evaluated via projects and assignments, a midterm exam, a final exam, and active participation.  Weights will be Projects and assignments 45%, midterm 25%, final 25%, and 5% for participation.

      <p> <b>Note:</b> The team receives one grade for the group project. However, allocation of the grade among team members will in some cases not be equal, if team members do not contribute relatively equally to the effort.</p>

<h3>Classroom Policies</h3>
      This class is our community.
      <p>Every student should feel safe and welcome to contribute in this course, and it is all of our jobs to make sure this is the case. I will try to establish this tone whenever possible, but ultimately the responsibility for cultivating a safe and welcoming community belongs to the students—that means you! Fortunately, forming a safe and welcoming community is not too hard. A good place to start is to recognize (and continually remind yourself) of the following facts:
            </p><ul>
<li>Your classmates come from a variety of cultural, economic, and educational backgrounds. Something that is obvious to you may not be obvious to them, and vice versa.</li>
<li>Your classmates are human beings with intelligence and emotions. This applies even when one or the other of you is posting anonymously. Rudeness and disrespect are unprofessional, and have no place in this course or in your career.</li>
<li>Your classmates are here to learn. They have the right to pursue their education without being distracted by others' disruptive behavior, or made uncomfortable by inappropriate jokes or unwanted sexual interest.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the <a href="http://oregonstate.edu/studentconduct/offenses-0">OSU Expectations for Student Conduct</a> apply.</p>
<p>In short, treat your classmates as respected colleagues, support each other when needed, have fun without spoiling it for anyone else, and everybody wins.</p>
<h4>Laptops and phones in the class</h4>
<p>(1) You are welcome to take notes on your laptop, but this can be distracting to others, so please sit in the back if you do this.  (2) If you find yourself trying to keep an eye on your emails and messages during class, know that you are missing out on a lot of information that will eventually prove useful to your project and your grade.  As you'll learn in this class, we humans pay a huge cognitive tax when we try to multitask. You'll be better off as a student and a future professional if you learn to wait till after class to check your phone/etc.</p>
<h3>Students with Disabilities</h3>
<p>
      Accommodations for students with disabilities are determined and
      approved by Disability Access Services (DAS). If you, as a student,
      believe you are eligible for accommodations but have not obtained
      approval please contact DAS immediately at 541-737-4098 or at
      <a href="http://ds.oregonstate.edu">http://ds.oregonstate.edu</a>.
      DAS notifies students and faculty members
      of approved academic accommodations and coordinates implementation of
      those accommodations. While not required, students and faculty members
      are encouraged to discuss details of the implementation of individual
      accommodations.
