<h2><a name="course"><font color="black">Course Description and Prerequisites</font></a></h2>
<b>Course description:</b>
<p>
State-based systems are used widely in computer science
to model concrete systems such as digital hardware, 
software programs, and distributed systems.
Coalgebra is a unifying framework for
studying the behaviour of state-based systems.
In coalgebra,
a system is viewed as a black box where knowledge of the system's
state can only be obtained by observing the external behaviour.
In particular,
two states <em>s</em> and <em>t</em> are considered equivalent 
if whenever we run the system starting in state <em>s</em>, 
the observed behaviour is the same as when we run the system in 
starting in state <em>t</em>.
The type of observations and transitions in the 
external behaviour is specified by the system type. 
The theory of <em>universal coalgebra</em>
provides general definitions of observable behaviour and bisimilarity
that can be instantiated for concrete system types,
as well as a powerful and fascinating reasoning principle called 
<em>coinduction</em> (a notion
that is dual to the well known induction principle).
</p><p>
This course is an introduction to coalgebra.
The course starts by studying how various types of systems can be modelled as
coalgebras, and how coinduction can be applied to them.
These systems include basic datatypes, 
such as infinite streams and trees, and many types 
of automata (deterministic, nondeterministic, probabilistic, ...).
Next, a number of fundamental notions 
such as language equivalence of automata,
bisimilarity of processes, and
determinisation of nondeterministic automata,
will be treated coalgebraically.
The coalgebraic framework will then be used to obtain
generalisations of these constructions to other types of systems.

</p><p>
Coalgebra is a rather recent field of research, existing for 
a mere two decades, 
and it is attracting an enthusiastic, ever-growing community.
Being relatively young, it still has many elementary and exciting 
research questions to offer.

</p><p>
<b>Prerequisites:</b> 
We only assume basic knowledge of automata, formal languages
and propositional logic, for example, as covered in the courses
Talen en Automaten, Discrete Wiskunde, Beweren en Bewijzen, en 
Semantiek en Correctheid.
With respect to category theory and modal logic,
the course will be self-contained: 
Only basic definitions will be needed, and these will be
introduced as part of the course.

<h2><a name="grading"><font color="black">Grading</font></a></h2>
The <b>final grade</b> will be the 0.3 * H1+ 0.3 * H2 + 0.4 * E,
where H1 and H2 are the grade given for the two exntended homework assignments
and E is the grade given for the final exam.
