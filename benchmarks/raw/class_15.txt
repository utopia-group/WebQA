<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The objectives of this course are that, by the end:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You will be able to articulate and apply principles of
engineering sensibility: simplicity, safety from bugs, ease of
understanding, readiness for change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will have a solid grasp of, and ability to apply, key
software engineering ideas, including interfaces, representation
invariance, specifications, invariants, data abstraction, design
patterns, and unit testing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will be able to design, implement, and test a small- to
medium-scale software system (thousands of lines of code, multiple
modules).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will have experience developing software collaboratively in
a team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will have experience with modern programming tools (e.g.
Eclipse, git, JUnit) and modern programming technologies (e.g.
regular expressions, network sockets, threads, GUIs).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Course Elements</h2>
<p>
<strong>Lectures</strong>. There are three 1-hour lectures each
week. You are expected to attend all the lectures and to
participate actively in discussions.</p>
<p>
<strong>Recitations</strong>. There are two 1-hour recitations
each week. You are expected to attend one recitation each
Tuesday/Thursday and participate regularly.  Though we ask you
to use Stellar to select a primary recitation slot, it is allowed
to attend different slots occasionally.</p>
<strong>Laptops required.</strong>
<p>Recitations (and occasional lectures) will have programming
exercises that require a laptop. If you don't have your own
laptop and you need to borrow one, IS&amp;T has a <a href="http://ist.mit.edu/services/hardware/lcp">laptop loaner
program</a> that will lend you one.</p>
<p>
<strong>Text</strong>. There is no course text, but lecture and
recitation notes will be posted online.</p>
<p>
<strong>Problem sets</strong>. To consolidate your understanding
of the lecture ideas, you will do four problem sets, involving both
design and implementation work. Problem sets will be done
individually.</p>
<p>
<strong>Code review</strong>. After each problem set submission
deadline, there will be a 3-day code-reviewing period when other
students, staff, and alumni will give you feedback about the code
you submitted, using a web-based system. You will be expected to
participate in this process by reviewing some of your
classmates' code. More details about objectives and guidelines
for the code reviewing process will be found in a separate document
on this web site.</p>
<p>
<br/>
<strong>Beta and Final Submission</strong>. Each problem set will
have beta and final submission. The beta submission will be graded
by an automated tester, and will be subject to code review. The
final submission is due a week later. You will be expected to fix
any failed test cases and revise your code based on code review
feedback. The beta submission is worth 40% of the problem set
grade, and the final is worth 60%.</p>
<p>
<strong>Projects</strong>. You will complete two small software
development projects, each of which goes all the way from
specification and design to coding and testing. All projects will
be done in teams of three students. You'll have the opportunity
to choose who to work with, and we'll do our best to honor your
choices. Any pair of students, however, will only be allowed to
work together on a single project. Each team member is required to
participate roughly equally in every activity (design,
implementation, test, documentation), and we may ask for an
accounting of what each team member did. Each project will have a
deliverable after one week (usually an initial design and some
initial code), and a final deliverable on the deadline. A single
grade will be assigned to all students in the project.</p>
<p>
<strong>Team meetings</strong>. During the projects, you and
your project team will meet with your TA to discuss the work. Your
TA will assign a grade based in part on this meeting. Team meetings
will usually be scheduled during lecture or recitation times that
will be reserved for this purpose.</p>
<p>
<strong>Quizzes</strong>. There will be two quizzes, on dates
specified on the course calendar. Each quiz will be comprehensive,
drawing on any lecture and recitation topics covered up to that
point in the course, so Quiz 2 may include topics that were already
covered on Quiz 1.</p>
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>The relative contributions of the various elements to your grade
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Quizzes: 20%.</strong> Q1 and Q2 have equal weight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Problem sets: 45%.</strong> PS0 is worth 5%, and PS1-PS4
are each worth 10%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Projects: 30%.</strong> Project 1 is worth 13%, and
Project 2 is worth 17%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Code review: 5%.</strong> Judged by regular
participation in code review, and providing substantive, useful
comments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lateness and Extensions</h2>
<p>To give you some flexibility for periods of heavy workload,
minor illness, absence from campus, and other unusual
circumstances, you may request limited extensions on problem set
deadlines, called <em>slack days</em>. Each slack day is a 24-hour
extension on the deadline. You have a budget of <strong>8 slack
days</strong> for the entire semester, which you may apply to any
combination of problem sets, on either the beta deadline or final
deadline or both. You can use at most 2 slack days for a given
deadline; after 2 days, whatever is in your git repository is what
we will use for grading.</p>
<p>You must request your extension before the problem set is due,
by logging into the code-reviewing system and clicking on Request
Extension. The system keeps track of your slack days and informs
you how many you have left.</p>
<p>Slack days are atomic; you can't chop them up into slack
hours or minutes. If you choose to use a slack day because
you're struggling with an assignment, GO TO BED AND SLEEP, and
get help in the morning. Seriously, that's why the smallest
unit is a day.</p>
<p>Slack days apply only to individual problem sets, not to team
projects.</p>
<p>If you have used up your slack days, or exceeded the 2-day limit
for a single deadline, you will need a lecturer's permission
and support from an S^3 dean for more extension, and your
circumstances will have to be extreme to justify the special
request.</p>
<h2>Collaboration</h2>
<p>In line with the Departmental Guidelines Relating to Academic
Honesty, here are our expectations regarding collaboration and
sharing.</p>
<p>For the team projects, you are encouraged to collaborate with
your partners on all aspects of the work, and each of you is
expected to contribute a roughly equal share to design and
implementation. You may reuse designs, ideas and code from your own
work earlier in the semester (even if it was done in a team project
with a different partner). You may also use material from external
sources, so long as: (1) the material is available to all students
in the class; (2) you give proper attribution; and (3) the
assignment itself allows it. In particular, if the assignment says
"implement X," then you must create your own X, not reuse
someone else's.</p>
<p>Problem sets are intended to be primarily individual efforts.
You are encouraged to discuss approaches with other students but
your write-up must be your own. You should not make use of any
written solutions or partial solutions produced by others. Material
from external sources can also be used with proper attribution, but
only if the assignment allows it. You may not use materials
produced as course work by other students in the course, whether in
this term or previous terms, nor may you provide work for other
students to use.</p>
<p>Copying work, or knowingly making work available for copying, in
contravention of this policy is a serious offense that may incur
reduced grades, failing the course and disciplinary action.</p>
<h2>Questions?</h2>
<br/>
<strong>Before you ask</strong>
<br/>
<p>... try to find the answer yourself, using the course Stellar
site, or the Java documentation, or the course Piazza forum, or
just by searching the Web.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>For problem set questions and debugging help</strong>
<br/>
...ask a LA or TA during office hours<br/>
...or ask on the course Piazza forum<br/>
<br/>
<strong>For group project questions</strong>
<br/>
... ask your TA mentor<br/>
<br/>
<strong>For questions about lecture content, to give feedback, and
for special requests and concerns</strong>
<br/>
...ask a lecturer.<br/>
