<h2>6.033 Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>After 6.033, the students will be able to design their own
  distributed systems to solve real-world problems.  The ability to
  design one's own distributed system includes an ability to argue for
  one's design choices.

</p><p>This primary objective is supported by a few others:

</p><ul>
<li>The students will be able to evaluate and critique existing
  systems, as well as their own system designs.  As part of that, students
  will learn to recognize design choices made in existing systems.
</li><li>The students will be able to apply the technical material taught
  in lecture to new system components.  This implies an ability to
  recognize and describe:
<ul>
<li>How common design patterns in computer system—such as abstraction
  and modularity—are used to limit complexity.
</li><li>How operating systems use virtualization and abstraction to enforce
  modularity.
</li><li>How the Internet is designed to deal with scale, a diversity of
  applications, and competing economic interests.
</li><li>How reliable, usable distributed systems are able to be built on top
  of an unreliable network.
</li><li>Common pitFalls in the security of computer systems, and how to combat
  them.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>Because 6.033 is a CI-M class, students will also learn to
  communicate in forms that are common in the field of computer
  systems. This includes written design reports, oral presentations,
  and peer review.

</p><p>The communication instruction also supports the primary learning
  objective of designing systems.  In the real world, we design
  systems in teams, and communication of many forms (written, oral,
  etc.) is part of that process.

</p><p><b>Prerequisites:</b> 6.004; 6.005 or 6.009<br/>
<b>Units:</b> 5-1-6 <br/>
<b>Requirements satisfied:</b> CI-M for Course 6-1, 6-2, 6-3, 6-P, and

of Computer System Design: An Introduction</a></i> (Morgan Kaufmann
2009).  The text supplements the lectures and recitations; it should
be your first resource when you are confused by a lecture topic, or
want more information.  </p>

<a name="structure">
<h2>Course Structure</h2>
<!-- Put learning objectives for lectures, recitations, and tutorials --
  -- here. -->
<p>6.033 has three components: lectures, recitations, and tutorials.
  We expect you to attend all three, as they each serve a different
  purpose.

</p><h3>Lectures</h3>
<p> <b>Lectures</b> are held on Mondays and Wednesdays from 2:00pm-3:00pm in
    26-100.  The lectures are designed to teach students the technical details
  necessary to design their own systems and to put those details in
  larger contexts: both the contexts of a specific area of systems as
  well as systems in general.

</p><p>This type of material appears in lectures because that's what lectures
  are good at: giving a higher-level context for the details of the
  class.

</p><h3>Recitations</h3>
<p><b>Recitations</b> are held on Tuesdays and Thursdays (schedule
  below).  For the first recitation, attend whichever one
  you want.  After that, you will be assigned a permanent section.

</p><p>Recitations are designed to give students a chance to practice
  their system-analysis and oral communication skills. Each recitation
  revolves around a particular paper in systems.  Through reading
  these papers, students get a better sense of how communication in
  the field is done.  Recitations are discussion-based; students get
  practice analyzing, critiquing, and communicating about systems.

</p><h3>Writing Tutorials</h3>
<p><b>Writing tutorials</b> are held on Fridays (schedule
  below).  <b>All tutorials occur at 1:00pm or 2:00pm</b>; we will
  assign you timeslot during the first week of classes.

</p><p>Most of these tutorials will teach the communication theory and
  practices of this course, and assist you in preparing for the
  assignments. You'll become fluent in a variety of communication
  genres, develop strategies and skills needed to present technical
  concepts to different audiences, learn how to use writing to develop
  and deepen your technical understanding—and get specific, directed
  instruction on writing and presenting your 6.033 assignments.  A
  handful of the tutorials will be dedicated to discussing the design
  project.</p>
</a><a name="sched">
<h2>Recitation + Tutorial Schedule</h2>
<div class="note"><center>All recitation sections meet on
	Tuesdays <b>and</b> Thursdays at the specified time.  All tutorials meet on

<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>6.033 consists of three components: technical material,

<div class="note"><b>You must complete all design project assignments in order to
  pass 6.033.  If you do not, you will automatically receive an
  F.</b></div>
<a name="late"> </a>
<h3>Late Policy</h3>

You must hand in assignments when they are due, and you must attend
quizzes at the scheduled times. If you feel you have a compelling
reason for not handing in an assignment on time, or for not attending
a quiz, please talk to Dr. LaCurts <b>in advance</b>; with support
from <a href="http://mit.edu/uaap/s3/">S3</a> we will make exceptions.

<p>The only exception to this late policy is design-project materials.
  For those, the late policy will be explicitly posted on each
  assignment.

</p><p>If you miss an assignment deadline, you should still hand in the
assignment; we'll give you feedback even though we won't give you
credit for your final grade.  Furthermore, doing assignments is the
best way to prepare for exams and design project.  Unless otherwise
specified, assignments are due at 5:00pm on their assigned due-date
(hands-ons are due at 11:59pm).

<a name="comp">
<h2>Grade Components</h2>
<p>Each assignment supports the objectives of 6.033 in various ways.

</p><h3>Technical Material</h3>
<p> <b>Quizzes:</b> One quiz is held during the term. A second quiz
    will be scheduled during finals week. Each quiz will focus on half
    of the class' material, but keep in mind that later topics in
    6.033 build heavily upon the earlier topics.  The quizzes will
    test material from lectures, recitations, and the assigned
    reading, and let us test whether students have mastered the
    technical material.</p>
<p> <b>Hands-ons:</b> During most weeks, you will be expected to
    complete a hands-on experiment that requires a computer, usually
    an Athena workstation, and sometimes the Internet. These reinforce
    some of the abstract concepts from the lectures or papers that
    week, and let you find out how things really work.

</p><h3>Communication + System design and analysis</h3>
<p>The 6.033 staff have worked with the MIT Writing, Rhetoric, and
  Professional Communication (WRAP) program for more than 10 years to
  design 6.033 writing and speaking assignments. We have chosen
  assignments that are similar to the kinds of writing you will do in
  the engineering workplace: preliminary reports, final
  reports, and presentations. Communication assignments are designed
  to help you conceptualize and develop the design project.</p>
<h4>Design Project</h4>
<p>The primary assignment in 6.033 is the design project (DP).  This
project is where the students get to design their own system, which is
the primary objective of this course.

</p><p> The DP requires you to develop a detailed system design to solve a
real-world problem.  This project will extend over most of the
semester, and will be done in teams of three students, all of whom
attend the same writing tutorial (with exceptions only for extenuating
circumstances). Real-world systems are not built individually; it's
always a team effort.  Part of the DP is to learn to work productively
and effectively in this setting.  We will give you tools for doing so
in the writing tutorials.

</p><p>The DP consists of multiple deliverables: a preliminary report,
  oral presentation, final report, and peer review.
  The <a href="dp.shtml">Design Project</a> page gives more detail
  about the DP deliverables.

</p><h4>System Critiques</h4>
<p>One of the goals of 6.033 is for students to be able to analyze and
  critique technical systems.  We will assign multiple system critiques
  during the semester.

</p><p>These critiques will be graded by your TAs and/or Communication
  Instructors, and assigned a letter grade (we will specify more
  details about grading in each of the assignments).  The
  expectations for each individual critique will be detailed in the
  tutorials.  As your skills at analyzing and reading technical papers
  improve throughout the semester, we will expect your critiques to
  reflect that.

<a name="participation">
<h3>Participation</h3>
<h4>Recitation Participation</h4>
<p>Our recitations are discussion-based, and we expect you to be
  engaged and participate.  Participating in a recitation means:

</p><ul>
<li>Coming prepared to recitation (doing the reading, turning in the
pre-reading question etc.)
</li><li> Paying attention when the instructor is speaking (you can't
  participation in a discussion if you don't know what it's about)
</li><li>Participating (verbally) in pair-/group-work
</li><li>Volunteering to answer questions when the instructor asks them.
  (Note that you may not get called on each time.  That's okay; our
  class sizes prevent that.  Statistically, if you're raising your
  hand frequently, you'll get called on with some frequency.)
</li><li>Responding to other student's comments with an opinion of their own.
</li><li>Asking good questions in recitation (where "good" just means it's
  clear that you prepared for the recitation).
</li></ul>
<p>We will assign the participation grade at the end of the
  semester. So that you know where you stand throughout the class, we
  will you three preliminary participation grades (one about a quarter
  into the semester, one about halfway through, and one three quarters
  into the semester). <a href="participation.pdf">This document</a>
  explains in more detail how your participation grade is determined.

<!--<p>Just like we expect you to be engaged in recitation, we also expect
  you to be engaged with the class as a whole, including the
  syllabus.  To that end, once you've read this, please send
  Dr. LaCurts your favorite .gif (a link to it is fine).-->
</p><h4>Communication Participation</h4>
<p> A portion of your participation grade will also be based on your
  participation in writing tutorials and on your understanding of
  communication concepts and skills, as demonstrated by your work on
  the design project and evaluated by your communication
  instructor.</p><p>
</p><p>Note that over a third of your grade comes from written
assignments: we expect you to take writing seriously in this class.

<a name="collaboration"> </a>
</p><h2>Collaboration</h2>
<p> You may not collaborate on quizzes.  On hands-ons, it's okay to
    discuss ideas with your classmates, but you should not be
    collaborating on the actual answers.  Take the UNIX hands-on for
    example: it's okay to talk to your classmates about what pipes
    are, it's not okay to work together to come up with a command that
    gives a long listing of the smallest give files in the /etc
    directory whose name contains the string ".conf", sorted by
    increasing file size (i.e., the solution to one of the first
    questions).
