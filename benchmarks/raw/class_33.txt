<h2><a id="over"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>

    What qualities make a program good?  How can we tell if a program is
    good?  How can we build good programs?  We will consider these
    questions as we explore concepts and techniques for the design and
    construction of reliable and maintainable software systems in modern
    high-level languages; program structure and design; program-correctness
    approaches, including testing; and event-driven programming. To
    practice the concepts from lecture, we will build substantial projects.

<h2><a id="syllabus"></a>Syllabus</h2>
<p>
<strong>Goals:</strong> There is a level of programming maturity beyond
  introductory programming that comes from building larger systems and
  understanding how to specify them precisely, manage their complexity,
  and verify that they work as expected.  After completing this course
  successfully students should be able to:

</p><ul><li>

    Successfully build medium-scale software projects in principled ways

  </li><li>

    Understand the role of specifications and abstractions and how to
    verify that an implementation is correct, including effective testing
    and verification strategies and use of formal reasoning

  </li><li>

    Analyze a software development problem and be able to design
    effective program structures to solve it, including appropriate
    modularity, separation of abstraction and implementation concerns,
    use of standard design patterns to solve recurring design problems,
    and use of standard libraries

  </li><li>

    Use modern programming languages effectively, including understanding
    type systems, objects and classes, modularity, notions of  identity
    and equality, and  proper use of exceptions and assertions

  </li><li>

    Use and learn new contemporary software tools, including integrated
    development environments, test frameworks, debuggers, version
    control, and documentation processing tools

</li></ul><p>

  To gain experience we will use Java and associated tools like Eclipse,
  JUnit, JavaDoc, and git, but the goal is to understand the underlying
  ideas and concepts that are widely applicable to software construction.

</p><p>
<strong>Prerequisite:</strong> The only formal prerequisite is CSE 143.
  We will very much rely on a thorough understanding of the concepts from
  CSE 143 as well as Java programming skills. We will go much further and
  you will be challenged to approach software development much differently
  than you have in CSE 143 or other courses.

</p><p>
<strong>Grading and Exams:</strong> Your overall grade will be determined
  as follows (subject to change as necessary, but substantial changes to
  the numbers below is unlikely):

</p><ul>
<li>55% - Homework assignments, approximately weekly</li>
<li>17% - Midterm exam</li>
<li>23% - Final exam</li>
<li>5% - Reading quizzes and other participation</li>
</ul><p>

  There is approximately one assignment per week, but not on an exact
  schedule (i.e., assignments may be due on different days).  The
  assignments are <em><strong>not</strong></em> weighted equally because
  they are of different length and sophistication. The exact weighting is
  to-be-determined and is not likely to be published in advance (we need to
  see how the course goes). Later assignments are likely to be weighted
  more heavily because they are more involved.

</p><p>
<strong>Late Policy:</strong> Deadlines will be given with each
  assignment.  These deadlines are strict. For the entire quarter, you may
  have <strong>four "late days"</strong>. You are strongly advised
  to save them for emergencies. You may not use more than two for the same
  assignment.  They must be used in 24-hour (integer) chunks.  This policy
  may not be the same as in your other classes. You are responsible for
  understanding it if you choose to submit late work.

</p><p>
<strong>Academic Integrity:</strong> Any attempt to misrepresent the work
  you submit will be dealt with via the appropriate University mechanisms,
  and your instructor will make every attempt to ensure the harshest
  allowable penalty.  The guidelines for this course and more information
  about academic integrity are <a href="#integrity">below</a>. You are
  responsible for knowing that information.

</p><p>
<strong>Texts: </strong>There are two required books for the course:

</p><ul>
<li><em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em> by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas, Addison-Wesley, 1999.</li>
<li><em>Effective Java</em> by Joshua Bloch, 2nd ed., Addison-Wesley, 2008.</li>
</ul><p>

  These books contain a great deal of distilled wisdom about software
  construction in general and Java best practices, technical details, and
  style issues.  Reading about software development is an important skill.

</p><p>

  There will be assigned readings from these books during the quarter, and
  you will be required to complete short online quizzes from time to time
  about the readings.

</p><p>
<strong>Advice: </strong>
</p><ul><li>

    Do not skip class or section to work on homework, not even late in the
    quarter when you are more tired and busy. This will cost you time (not
    to mention learning) in the long run. Class will start promptly, and
    you will find the entire course easier and more educational if you
    arrive punctually, well-rested, and ready to pay attention for 50
    minutes.

  </li><li>

    Do buy a Java programming book. In general, a large, well-written
    reference book for any programming language you are using is a great
    value, sure to save you time over frustrating web-searching and time on
    sites like stackoverflow.com (though those are useful too -- it is not
    "one or the other"). Web-searching is cheaper, but you are spending a
    lot of money on your education and will likely get a high-paying job
    when you finish. The cost of a book that <em>helps you do better</em>
    in classes, internships, etc. is <em>miniscule</em> compared to the
    benefits you get from doing better work in less time. And such a book
    will be valuable long after you complete CSE331.

    A common misconception about this course is that the lectures,
    readings, and homeworks are disconnected. They are different since
    there is no point repeating something in multiple ways, but they also
    are connected. If you are approaching a homework and not using the
    concepts in the rest of the course materials, <em>you are making it
    harder</em>. When you are sawing something with a dull blade, it can
  seem like you do not have time to sharpen the blade because you need to
  finish sawing. In fact, you likely do not have time not to stop and
  sharpen the blade.

  </li><li>

    Start homeworks early. They are more difficult than assignments in
    earlier courses and you need time to make mistakes.

  </li><li>

    Enjoy this course and learn a lot. It is invaluable for making you a
    better software developer. The more you master these ideas now, the
    more effective you can be in jobs, other courses, and any other
    projects.

<strong>Approximate Topics (subject to change):</strong> We expect to
  cover the following, with an emphasis on specification and design. The
  order these are listed is only very rough as we will revisit some topics
  iteratively.

</p><ul>
<li>Reasoning about programs: pre- and post-conditions, invariants, and correctness</li>
<li>Abstract data types, specification, implementation, abstraction functions,  representation invariants, notions of equality</li>
<li>Java language issues: subclasses and subtypes, generics, exceptions, assertions, etc.</li>
<li>Tools: Eclipse IDE,  version control, git</li>
<li>Code quality, style, comments, documentation, JavaDoc</li>
<li>Testing, test coverage, black- and white-box testing, test-first development, regression testing, JUnit</li>
<li>Debugging strategies and tools</li>
<li>Design: modular design, coupling, cohesion; design patterns</li>
<li>User interfaces, callbacks, separation of model from view/control</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="integrity"></a>Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>
<strong>You are responsible for understanding every word in this document.</strong>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Motivation:</strong>    A course in which students do not accurately present what they know and the
    work they have done is worse than having no course at all. Your instructor
    and your fellow students expect
    and deserve a basic respect for the integrity of this course and an environment
    where we can all focus on learning. Therefore, this document establishes
    a clear understanding of what we all will do with
    the expectation that it will never be an issue.<br/>
<br/>
</li>
<li> <strong>Bottom Line:</strong> If you are
    ever unclear about how to represent what work you have done, (a) ask and
    (b) describe clearly what you have done. If you do, the worst
    that will happen is you will lose some
    credit on an assignment. This is much better than the alternative.
    <br/>
<br/>
    If you are at all in doubt about whether your collaboration was appropriate,
    include a description of your collaboration with your homework submission.
    <br/>
<br/>
    If the course staff receives homework submissions that are too similar to
    have been created independently, or are derived from
    other  sources, we will pursue the maximum penalty allowed by
    the
    University.<br/>
<br/>
</li>
<li> <strong>Collaboration:</strong> You are encouraged to discuss the material in
    this course, including homework problems.
    We all learn better when we trade ideas with others, including course staff
    and fellow students.
    But you must produce your own homework
    solutions and you must not look at other students'
    solutions or other information that takes away the intellectual challenge
    of the homework.
    <br/>
<br/>
    Unless specifically told otherwise, you are to complete
    assignments individually. You may discuss
    assignments in general terms with other students including a discussion of
    how to approach a problem, but the code and other work you submit must be your own.
   The intent is to allow you to get some help when you
    are stuck, but this help should be limited and should never involve details
    of how to write a solution. You may not have another person (current student,
    former
    student, tutor, friend, anyone) "walk you
    through" how to solve an assignment.  <br/>
<br/>
    Copying someone else's homework or receiving unfair help
    completing your assignment is cheating (see below), as is copying the
    homework from another source (the web, other classes, previous course
    offerings, etc.).
    <br/>
<br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Cheating:</strong> Cheating is a very serious offense. If
    you are caught cheating, you can expect a failing grade and initiation
    of a cheating case in the University system. Cheating is an insult to
    your colleagues, to the instructors, to the department and major
    program, and most importantly, to you. If you feel that you are having
    a problem with the material, or do not have time to finish an
    assignment, or have any number of other reasons to cheat, then talk
    with the instructor. Copying others' work is not the solution.
    <br/><br/>
    To avoid creating situations where copying can arise, never e-mail
    or post your solution files. When using the class discussion board, do
    not post code that is an attempt to solve a homework problem. If in
    doubt about what might constitute cheating, send the instructor email
    describing the situation.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Fine Print:</strong> It's not effective for us to try to define a list of all impermissible activities.
  That approach can tempt people to look for loopholes.
  Consider: "the code you write must be your own."
  This includes things like not using any substantive material or solutions from
  similar assignments this term or previous terms at UW or elsewhere,
  including anywhere on the Internet, transcribing solutions from any
  other source, etc.  Our policy is intended to convey the spirit of
  the law, fully understanding that the letter of the law may not
  cover everything that someone may think of.  <br/>
