<h3>Scope of the Course </h3> 
This is the second course in the Elements of Software series. I assume
that you know a programming language (C / Java / Python) at the level 
taught in CS 303E. The emphasis of this course will be on software 
development using object-oriented methodology. 

<p>
We will learn how to analyze and design software. We will learn how to 
create reusable software components and to compose programs from already 
available components. We will learn about some basic data structures and 
algorithms and how to match the data structures and algorithms to problems. 
We will test and evaluate programs for their functionality and their 
performance. 
</p>
<p>
We will be following the required text book closely. I will provide notes 
in class that will be posted on the web for topics that are not covered in
the book. Unlike the traditional lecture format, our classes will be a venue 
for solving problems, writing programs, and exchanging, ideas. <b>Attendance 
to the lectures is mandatory.</b> If you are not there for any lecture you 
need to send me an e-mail explaining why.
</p>
<h3>Assignments </h3>
<p>
There will be programming assignments that you can complete in the CS Lab. 
You may choose to use your own computer to work on these assignments. If you 
work on your home computer, you will have to download and install Python 3.
There is a graphical development environment (IDLE) that comes with Python
that you can also install.
</p>
<p>
The only way to learn programming is to program. Doing the programming
assignments is crucial to performing well in class. There will be on the
average two assignments every week. The assignments will be due on Mondays
and Fridays. Each assignment will have a clearly stated due date and time. 
Assignments start out being easy but get harder over the semester. If you 
are having considerable difficulty with Assignments 2 and/or 3, please see 
the Instructor immediately. 
</p>
<p>
The assignments will require a substantial time commitment over several
days (an average of 10 to 12 hours per week should be expected). Be sure 
to budget sufficient time to complete assignments before the deadline. 
</p>
<p>
Turn in your assignments on time. This permits grading to start promptly 
after the submission deadline so that assignments maybe returned promptly. 
If you do not finish an assignment by the deadline you have a maximum of 
two days to turn your assignment in. However, there is a penalty of 10 
points (out of a 100 points) per day. Your assignment is one day late until 
the midnight of the day after it is due, two days late from then until 
midnight of the second day. We will accept your assignment after two days 
if there is a compelling reason. 
</p>
<p>
Specific grading criteria vary on each assignment. However, in general, 
programs that do not compile correctly on the CS Lab configuration will 
receive no more than 80% of the possible points. Other point deductions are 
given for such things as: incorrect results, missing features, bad solution 
logic, no documentation etc. No matter what configuration of software that 
you have on your home computer, the assignment that is turned in must run 
successfully on the CS Lab configuration in order to be graded. Here
is the <a href="./grading.html">general grading criteria</a> for 
programming assignments.
</p>
<p>
All assignments must be submitted using the web based
<a href="http://canvas.utexas.edu/"> Canvas </a> program. You must
always make a backup copy of the Python source code (i.e. the .py file) on 
your removable secondary storage device (e.g. flash drive). This will be 
necessary in cases where your program gets lost, is corrupted, or if there 
is some dispute over what was turned in when.
</p>
<p>
For assigned programs, the source code (.py file) must be turned in. The
source code must be a text file that can be run through a Python 3 interpreter.
Word processing files (those created with Microsoft Word, for example, and
ending with .doc extension ) will not be accepted.
</p>
<p>
If you want us to debug your program, come to us during our office
hours with your laptop and we will go through the program with you.
Do <b>NOT</b> just e-mail the program to us for debugging. We will
not respond to e-mails that have full length programs that have to
be debugged.
</p>
<p>
<b>Grade Dispute: </b> Scores for assignments will be posted on Canvas. You 
have one week from the date the assignment grade is posted to dispute your 
grade. The student assistants will be grading the assignments. Visit the TAs
and see if you can resolve your differences. If you cannot resolve your 
differences, you may visit me to explain the situation. 
<b><i> We will not entertain any grade disputes after one week. </i></b>
</p>
<p>
<b> Assignment Identification: </b> All assignments must be submitted with
the proper header, containing your name (as registered), your unique section 
number, and the assignment number at the top of the assignment. The format
for the header will be specified in the assignment. That specification will
over ride any other header specification.
</p>
<p>
In addition, because assignments are submitted as files on Canvas, they 
must have the correct file name, which will be specified in the assignment 
handout. You must also ensure that you turn in the assignment to the 
correct unique section folder - that is, the section you are currently
registered in. Lost assignments are typically caused by turning in an 
incorrect file name and/or turning a file into the wrong section folder.
Assignments, which omit the header or are incorrect in any one or more
of these requirements, will have the grade reduced by 5% of the maximum
grade.
</p>
<h3> Exercises </h3>
<p>
There will be assigned readings from the text and exercises that follow
the readings. You must do the readings and exercises by the due date
and time. <b> There are no extensions to the reading assignments. </b>
</p>
<h3> Quizzes </h3>
<p>
There will be in class quiz every day. There will be one or two questions 
in a given quiz. The questions will be from the reading assignments or the 
material discussed in class the previous day. The quizzes will be hosted 
on Canvas. You will need a smart phone or laptop to answer the questions. 
There are no makeup quizzes. I will drop the lowest of your three quiz 
grades. This number (three quizzes) is non-negotiable. This drop will take 
care of any absences that you may have or any electronic mishaps that you 
may have with your smart phone or laptop.
</p>
<h3>Tests </h3>
<p>
There will be three tests and no final examination. All three tests will
be on Fridays from 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm. There will be makeup tests on
Mondays from 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm. You need to give me documented evidence
that you cannot take the test on Fridays to be allowed to take the
makeup tests.

</table>
<p>
Make-up tests will be given only for the following reasons. In
all cases you must provide some form of documentation.
</p><ul>
<li> Ill health </li>
<li> Family emergency </li>
<li> Official UT conflict </li>
</ul>
Having three tests on the same day is <i>not</i> official UT conflict!
For each test you may bring a non-programmable calculator and a single
8 1/2 x 11 sheet with handwritten notes (no photo reduction) on both
sides of the paper. 


<p>
Questions concerning test grades should be given to me in writing along 
with your test within the next class day that the test is handed back. 
We will not entertain any disputes after that time.
</p>
<h3>Grades </h3> 
Your performance in this class will be evaluated using your scores for
quizzes, reading exercises, programming assignments, and three tests. The 
weights of each of these components are listed below. <i> There are no 
extra credit projects or assignments to improve your grade.</i> We do not 
drop any of the assignment scores nor do we drop any of the reading exercises
scores. We only drop the lowest three quiz scores.
<ul>
<li> Quizzes: 10% 
</li><li> Exercises: 15%
</li><li> Programming Assignments: 30%
</li><li> Three Tests (15% each): 45%
</li></ul>
<p>
All scores will be entered on Canvas. Check your scores regularly on
Canvas to make sure that we have entered them correctly. Remember the
average score as shown on Canvas is <b>not correct</b>. It does not
weight the average with weights as shown above. Your final grade will 
be assigned after we obtain the weighted average according to the weights 
as given above. Your grade will be based on the traditional scheme:
</p><ul>
<li> A: 90 - 100
</li><li> B: 80 - 89
</li><li> C: 70 - 79
</li><li> D: 60 - 69
</li><li> F: 0 - 59
</li></ul>
We do assign grades on the +/- system. But those finer cutoffs will be
determined at the very end after the weighted average and standard
deviation of the class are computed.


<p>
You can earn 5 points extra credit on the total sum of the three
tests for filling out the electronic evaluation for the class. To
obtain those extra credit points you must take a screen shot of the
fact that you completed the survey and then upload the screen shot 
to the appropriate slot in Canvas.
</p>
<h3> Study Groups </h3>
Please organize yourselves into study groups of ~5 students who will
meet once a week or more to discuss the course. Typically, you will 
review the lectures, do the reading, and attempt the homework independently
before your weekly meeting with your study group. Studying for tests 
together is permitted and encouraged. If you are unsure about how to 
work together with your friend in a legal, helpful manner, do come and
talk with us.  Remember, it is always ok to "work together" with your 
professor or TA! 

<p>
We will be using <a href="https://piazza.com/utexas"> Piazza </a>
for general discussion of class related questions rather than the
discussion board on Canvas. <b>Please do not post solutions or code
to any home work assignment problems on Piazza. </b>
</p>
<h3>Academic Misconduct Policy</h3>
While you are free to discuss the course material with your classmates 
and are encouraged to form study groups for the exams, collaboration on 
homework or programming assignments is <b>not</b> permitted. 

<p>
Helping a friend understand the intent of a homework or programming 
assignment specification is permitted. Students who work together too 
closely (e.g. design their solution together) should be aware that this 
is a form of cheating called COLLUSION and is subject to academic penalties. 
Penalties for academic misconduct include a failing grade in this course.
</p>
<p>
The homework, programs, and exams must be the work of students turning
them in. University policy (see Dean of Students' policies on 
<a href="http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php"> 
academic integrity</a>) will be followed strictly. We will be
running a sophisticated program on all submitted assignments to
detect plagiarism. If we do detect any cases of academic dishonesty,
we will assign a grade of F to all students involved and refer the
cases to the Dean of Students.
</p>
<p>
Acts that exceed the bounds defined by the approved collaboration
practices will be considered cheating. Such acts include:

</p><ul>
<li>Copying solutions, code, or programs from someone else or giving
someone else your solutions, code, or programs

</li><li>Participation in a discussion group that develops a solution that
everyone copies

</li><li> Posting your code to homework problems on Piazza or Facebook.

</li><li> Copying code from the internet (e.g. from Piazza or Facebook
or other internet sites)

</li><li> Employing someone to write the solutions for you on homework
assignment problems.
</li></ul>

We urge everyone in the class to take appropriate measures for
protecting one's work. You should protect your files, homework
solution sheets, etc. as deemed reasonable. The only exception 
that we will make to these guidelines is if you are involved
in <b>pair programming</b> with a friend.


<h3>Your Responsibilities in This Class</h3>
