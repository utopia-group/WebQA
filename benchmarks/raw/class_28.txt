<!--l. 33--><p class="noindent">The field of programming languages is as old as computing itself, and is central to the way we transform
abstract algorithmic notions to concrete executable plans. While some aspects of language design entail
issues related to choice of syntax (e.g., Lisp), contain features that are only relevant to the specific
domains in which the language is intended to operate (e.g., Cuda), or are centered around particular
methdologies the language designer wishes to promote (e.g., Javascript), other aspects of the
study of programming languages are more universal, concerned with exploring foundational
questions. That is, beyond thinking of programming languages in terms of qualitative judgments
(why is language <span class="cmmi-10x-x-109">X </span>better to write programs in than language <span class="cmmi-10x-x-109">Y </span>?), we might pursue a more
substantive line of inquiry centered around notions of <span class="cmti-10x-x-109">semantics </span>and <span class="cmti-10x-x-109">correctness </span>- how can
we best describe what a program does or means, without injecting subjective bias into our
characterization; and, how do we ascertain from this description, assurance that any execution of this
program will be faithful to the intent of the developer? Surprisingly, answers to these questions
can often be pursued without appealing to specific syntactic forms or any particular design
features.

<!--l. 54--></p><p class="noindent">More generally, these questions broadly Fall under the term <span class="cmti-10x-x-109">formal methods</span>, an important branch of
computer science that looks to mathematics (specifically, logic) to help us (at least in this class) precisely
reason about programming language features and behaviors. Our focus will be to explore core ideas in
programming languages from a rigorous, foundational, and principled perspective enabled by couching
programming language concepts and the vocabulary we use to reason about them in terms of
well-defined mathematical objects (e.g., sets, functions, relations) and associated reasoning
strategies (e.g., induction). To do so, we will undertake our study using small language definitions
(program calcuii), sufficiently expressive to serve as a useful object of study, but not burdened
with features that while perhaps necessary for real-world implementations, are semantically
uninteresting.
<!--l. 69--></p><p class="noindent">The course will be centered around the use of tools (proof assistants, model checkers, type systems) that
enable better understanding of how we might design, specify, and implement language features. We will
also use these tools to help us think about how to gain stronger assurance and confidence that the
programs we write do what we expect them to do.
<!--l. 76--></p><p class="noindent">From the above description, you can conclude that this course will <span class="cmti-10x-x-109">not </span>be a survey of existing languages or
a taxonomy of language constructs. Neither will it be a course on programming or software
engineering per se. Instead, presented material  will be structured to allow us to explore new ways to
understand programming languages generally that help us to answer questions such as the
following:
<!--l. 83--></p><p class="noindent">
</p><ol class="enumerate1">
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-4002x1">What is a program <span class="cmti-10x-x-109">specification </span>and what role do specifications play in program construction
     and reliability?
     </li>
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-4004x2">What does <span class="cmti-10x-x-109">program verification </span>mean?
     </li>
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-4006x3">What are sensible and tractable notions of program correctness? What are the conditions
     under which we can assert that a program is “safe”?
     </li>
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-4008x4">How do we <span class="cmti-10x-x-109">prove </span>useful properties about a program; what do we mean by a <span class="cmti-10x-x-109">proof  </span>in this
     context?
     </li>
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-4010x5">How do we qualify the “expressive power” of a language feature? How do we relate different
     features found in different languages?
     </li>
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-4012x6">What is a <span class="cmti-10x-x-109">type </span>and how can they be used to reason about program correctness?
     </li>
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-4014x7">How foundationally different are various methodologies espoused by different languages (e.g.,
     object-oriented, functional, imperative)?

     </li>
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-4016x8">How  do  we  reason  about  the  equivalence  of  programs,  or  programs  and  their  compiled
     translation?
     </li>
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-4018x9">What tools can we bring to bear to help automate the way we reason about a program’s
     behavior?
     </li></ol>
<!--l. 116--><p class="noindent">To help answer these questions, the course is designed around several interleaved themes: (1) the role of
logic and related mathematical formalisms in programming language specification and design; (2) formal
reasoning devices that precisely explain the meaning of programming language features and program
executions; (3) the use of types to define and specify safety conditions on program executions, and to
enrich language expressivity; (4) characterization of different notions of correctness and development of
mechanisms to verify that programs are correct with respect to their specification; (5) the use of
automated tools (e.g., proof assistants, program verifiers) to help validate important theorems that
describe useful properties based on the structure of (2) and (3), using techniques enabled by
(1).
<!--l. 129--></p><p class="noindent">By the end of the class, students should be comfortable with objectively assessing and comparing
superficially disparate language features, understanding how these features impact implementations, be
able to distinguish concepts that are truly foundational from those that just appear to be, and be able to
critically reason about program correctness and safety. Most importantly, the overarching goal of this
course is to equip students <span class="cmti-10x-x-109">to ask better questions </span>about language design, even if the answers themselves
are not readily apparent.

<!--l. 141--><p class="noindent">It is assumed that students taking this class would have had exposure to an undergraduate software
engineering and/or compilers class, and be comfortable with basic mathematical concepts, and software
implementation techniques. There will be a number of programming exercises in the class, but no prior
background in any specific programming language is necessary.

</p><h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a id="x1-6000"></a><span class="underline">Academic Honesty</span></h4>
<!--l. 150--><p class="noindent">Students are encouraged to work together to clarify issues presented in class. However, students are not
allowed to collaborate on programming assignments or examinations.
