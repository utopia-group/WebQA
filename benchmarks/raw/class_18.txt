<a name="intro"></a><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This subject offers an introduction to Discrete Mathematics
oriented toward Computer Science and Engineering.  This Spring there are
two class sessions MWF in 32-044 (EECS Tutorial Lounge):
  </p><ul>
<li> L01: 1－2:30PM
    </li><li> L02: 2:30PM－4:00PM
  </li></ul>  

There are no separate recitations.  In-class problem-solving teams
will be assigned by the second week of class.  You will need to work
with the same team in the same session at each class meeting.
(Contact the staff about needed assignment changes.)

<p>
  The subject coverage divides into three parts:
  </p><ol>
<li> Fundamental concepts of mathematics: definitions, proofs, sets,
      functions.

    </li><li> Discrete structures: elementary number theory, graphs, counting.

    </li><li> Discrete probability theory.
  </li></ol>
<p>
  The prerequisite is <span class="meyer">18.01</span> (first term
  calculus), in particular, some familiarity with sequences and series,
  limits, and differentiation and integration of functions of one variable.
</p>
<p>
  The goals of the class are summarized in a statement of 
  <a href="objectives">
<strong>Class Objectives and Educational Outcomes</strong></a>.  A detailed
  schedule of topic coverage appears in
  the <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=eiielbenhp7ck7jmgur9v3ik4o%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=America/New_York">Class
  Calendar</a>.
</p>
<a name="considerations"></a><h2>Considerations for Taking the Subject
This Term</h2>

There are two main considerations for students in deciding to take
6.042J/18.062J <strong>this term</strong> or at all.

<ol>
<li>
<a name="teams"></a><h3>Team Problem Solving</h3>

    This is a "flipped" class: students prepare by doing assigned
    reading and answering online questions <span class="meyer">before
    class</span>.  Class meeting time is then devoted almost entirely
    to problem solving in teams of 6 to 8 students sitting around a
    table with a nearby whiteboard where a team can write their
    solutions.  Participation in team sessions counts for
      <span class="meyer">25%</span> of the final grade.

    <p>
      The sessions are open book, and <span class="meyer">laptops,
      tablets, etc., are encouraged</span> for viewing class related
      material (viewing email, facebook and the like during class will
      be penalized).
    </p>
<p>
      Each team will have a TA/LA coach providing feedback on
      students' solutions.  The coach will initially resist answering
      questions about the material, always trying first to find a team
      member who can explain the answer to the rest of the team.  Of
      course the coach will provide hints and explanations when the
      whole team is stuck.  Instructors circulate among the teams
      overseeing class activity.  See
      the <a href="team-protocol">description of team protocols and
      grading</a> for more information about team activities.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="meyer">The Good News</span> is that the immediate,
      active engagement in problem solving sessions is an effective
      and enjoyable way for most students to master the material.
      Team sessions also provide a supervised setting to acquire and
      practice technical communication skills.  Student grades for
      problem solving sessions depend on degree of
      <strong>active, prepared</strong> participation, rather than problem
      solving success.  Sessions are not aimed to test how well a
      student can solve the problems in class; the goal is to have
      students understand how to solve them by the end of the session.

    </p><p>
<span class="meyerp">The Bad News</span> is that a team problem
      solving approach to teaching requires students to
      arrive <strong>prepared</strong> at the sessions: they need to
      do (though not carefully study) the assigned reading and do the
      online problems <span class="meyer">before class</span>.  The
      team problem solving aims to help solidify students'
      understanding of <strong>material they have already
      seen</strong>.  Watching designated videos, or at least looking
      at the lecture-slide handouts, is generally helpful
      but <em>optional</em>.  We expect that class preparation,
      including assigned reading and online material, will
      take <strong>1.5 hours per class</strong>.

    </p><p>
      There is no way to make up for not working with the team, so it
      is necessary to keep up and be there no focusing on
      some other activity for a month, aiming to catch up afterward.
      <strong><span class="purple">If you cannot commit to keeping up, you
	  may prefer to take the subject some other term.</span></strong>
	  (In Fall  2016, Math Department faculty are expected to teach
	  the class in standard lecture/recitation style.)
  </p></li>

<h3><a href="team-protocol">Team Grading & Protocols</a></h3>
More about team grading and protocols can be
found <a href="team-protocol">here</a>.
-->
<li> <h3>Department Requirement</h3>
<p>
      This subject is required of all Computer Science (6-3) majors
      and is in a required category for Math majors taking the
      Computer Science option (18C).  It covers many mathematical
      topics that are essential in Computer Science and are not
      covered in the standard calculus or algebra curriculum.  In
      addition, the subject teaches students about careful
      mathematics: precisely stating assertions about well-defined
      mathematical objects and verifying these assertions using
      mathematically sound proofs.  While some students have had
      earlier exposure to some of these topics, in most cases they
      learn a lot more in 6.042J/18.062J.
    </p>
<p>
      However, students who have a firm understanding of sound proofs
      and who are familiar with a significant fraction of the covered
      topics should discuss with the instructor and their advisor the
      possibility of
      <span class="meyer">substituting another subject</span>
      for 6.042.  It is also possible for qualified students to get
      <span class="meyer">credit for the class by serving as a Lab
      Assistant</span>.
    </p>

</ol>
<a name="schedule"></a><h2>Weekly Schedule</h2>
<ul>
<li> <h3>Class Text</h3>

    Weekly reading will be assigned from our own <a href="mcs.pdf">
class textbook</a>.
  </li>
<p>
</p><li><h3><a href="classinfo.shtml#online">Videos and Online
      Feedback Questions</a></h3>
      
      Video mini-lectures and online questions are posted on
the <a href="https://lms.mitx.mit.edu/courses/MITx/6.042r_1/2015_Spring/courseware">
6.042r</a> website.  Answers to online questions are due before each
class that they cover.
    </li>
<p>
</p><li><h3><a href="classinfo.shtml#psets"> Problem Sets</a></h3>

      Problem sets are due at 1PM on most Fridays.  They are assigned
      a week or more in advance.  The exact schedule is posted on the
      <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=eiielbenhp7ck7jmgur9v3ik4o%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=America/New_York">

</ul>
<a name="website"></a><h2>Class Website</h2>

The class has a comprehensive <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/sp15/6.042/">Stellar
web site</a>
<!--
<p align=center>
<span class="meyer">
<a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/sp15/6.042/">

</span></p>-->
where notes, problem sets, solutions, etc., will be posted.
Announcement and staff contact information are also available on this
website.  It is <strong>always worth checking the website</strong> for
corrections and announcements before starting problem sets.


<h2><a name="psets"></a>Problem Sets</h2>
<p>
<a name="pset-credit"></a>Problem sets count
  for <span class="meyer">15%</span> of the final grade.  Making a
  reasonable effort on the problem sets is, for most students, crucial
  for mastering the course material.  Problem sets are designed to be
  completed in at most 3 hours; the time is monitored through student
  reports.
</p>
<!--

<p>
  <a name="submission"></a>
  Electronic submission of problem sets is normally due
  by <span class="due">1PM on Fridays</span>.
  The <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/sp15/6.042/courseMaterial/topics/topic4/syllabus/text3/text">Problem Set Submission instructions</a>
  explain how.
  <span class="due">Late submissions</span> will <span class="due">not
  be accepted</span> once the solutions are posted.  Note that
  solutions are generally posted promptly after the time they are due.
  Late submissions received before solutions are posted may be
  accepted at the convenience of the graders.
</p>

<p>
  The guidelines for a good solution are similar to those for class
  problems: a prepared student who didn't see right away how
  to solve the problem should be able to read your answer and promptly
  see how to go about solving the problem themselves.  If you cannot
  solve a problem in a reasonable time, don't lose sleep over it: you
  can get useful credit by including an explanation of where and how
  you got stuck.
</p>

<p>
  Graders' time is limited, and they have been instructed to deny
  credit without struggling unduly to understand answers.  For this
  reason,
  <ul>
    <li> unclear answers may not receive adequate part credit (you
      won't get full credit for an unclear answer even if is
      ``correct''), and </li>
    <li> good but unusual answers are occasionally denied credit.</li>
  </ul>
  We encourage you to <span class="meyer">seek the credit you
  deserve</span> by asking either your team coach or emailing
    the <a class="email" href =
     "mailto:6042-gradesmaster@&#109;&#105;&#116;.edu?subject=grading%20concern">6042-webmaster(at)&#109;&#105;&#116;.edu</a>
    6042-gradesmaster(at)&#109;&#105;&#116;.edu</a>
  to review your solution.  If you are not satisfied with their
    response, you may appeal to one of the instructors.

<a name="online"></a><h2>Online Feedback Problems</h2>

Online problems to be completed before most class meetings are posted
on the <a href="https://lms.mitx.mit.edu/courses/MITx/6.042r/2015_Spring/"> 6.042r
website</a>.  These consist of straightforward questions that provide
useful feedback about the assigned material.  (Some students prefer to
try the online problems before reading the text or watching videos as
an advance guide to going over the material; that's fine.)  Watching
designated videos, or at least looking at the lecture-slide handouts,
is generally helpful but <em>optional</em>.

<p>
  Like team problem-solving in class, online problems are graded
  solely on <strong>participation</strong>: students receive full
  credit as long as they try the problem, even if their answer is
  wrong.  Online feedback problems count
  for <span class="meyer">5%</span> of the final grade.  
</p>
<h2><a name="collaboration"></a>Collaboration</h2>

  You are encouraged to collaborate on problem sets as you do on teams
  in class.  However, you must <span class="meyer">cite all your collaborators and any
  sources beyond this term's class materials</span> that you consulted while
  working on a problemfor example, an "expert" consultant
  other than 6.042 staff, or another textmust be <strong>given
  a proper scholarly citation</strong>, which you should include with
  the <a href="pset_instructions.shtml">collaboration
  statement</a> accompanying your submission.


<!--<h2>Other Sources</h2>-->

Class materials (excluding solutions) from Spring  2014 are available on the 
 <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/sp14/6.042/">Spring  2014
Stellar web site</a>.
  Materials including some solutions are available on MIT OCW for 
  <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-Fall-2010/">Fall  2010</a>,
  <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-Spring-2010/">Spring
   2010</a>.

<p>
  A problem from prior terms may occasionally be assigned again
  without change.  <span class="meyer">If you find a <strong>published
  solution, you should cite it, and you may not simply copy</strong>
  it</span>.  Instead, submit a critique of the published solution, an
  improved solution, or a suggestion for an improved or variant
  versionbasically any commentary that shows engagement
  with the material comparable to that required to solve the problem
  on its own.
</p>
<p>
  We discourage, but do not forbid, use of materials from terms prior
  to Spring  2014.  We repeat, however, that use of material from a
  previous term requires <span class="meyer"><strong>a proper
  scholarly citation</strong></span>.  As long as you provide an
  accurate citation and <a href="pset_instructions.shtml">
  collaboration statement</a>, a questionable submission will rarely
  be sanctionedinstead, we'll explain why we judge the
  submission unsatisfactory (and maybe deny credit for a specific,
  clearly copied solution).  But <strong>omission</strong> of such a
  citation will be taken as <strong>a priori</strong> evidence of
  cheating, with undesirable consequences for everyone.</p>

<p>If you are concerned about a possible violation of this kind, please
talk with your TA and/or the Lecturer.  It is better if you take the
initiative to contact us in such cases, rather than vice-versa.

<a name="prepchecks"></a><h2>Preparation checks</h2>


A preparation check consists of one or two questions which will be
easy to answer in 3&#150;&#150;5 minutes if you have prepared for
class (looked at the assigned reading and slides/videos)&#65293;but
not so easy if you haven't prepared.  Prep checks are given at the
beginning of nearly every class unless there is another exam.  Your
response is ranked <strong>P</strong> for <strong>p</strong>repared or <strong>U</strong>
for <strong>u</strong>nprepared.  Your team coach takes the preparation check
into account when assigning you a participation grade for the day's
class.

<p>
To write your preparation check solutions, you are expected to bring a
piece of paper (8.5 x 11in) and a pen to class.  Preparation checks
are closed book; no cribsheets.  You may fill out your name, session
(1PM, 2:30TEAL, 2:30Lounge) and Team label (1&#150;&#150;13 or
A&#150;&#150;L), and heading "Prep Check [month day], 2013" in
advance.
</p>

<p>
If you get a <strong>U</strong> or miss a prep-check, you may email
an <span class="meyer">appeal for upgrade</span> to your coach within
one week of the prep-check.  The email should include
<ul>
  <li>
    an honest indication of whether you actually made an effort to
    prepare for class&#65293;admitting you were not prepared will not
    disqualify you from an upgrade,
  </li>

  <li>
    an indication that you have found the proper answer to the
    prep-check (prep-check solns are usually not posted)
  </li>

  <li>
    a new prep-check question that would be suitable for this prep-check
    in a future term.
  </li>
</ul>
Upgrades are not guaranteed but remain at the discretion of your
coach.  (We do guarantee that <span class="meyer">you will not be
downgraded</span> because of an appeal.)  The bar for upgrades will be
set high enough to ensure that counting on appeals to make up for
being unprepared will not be a good strategy.
</p>


<a name="miniquizzes"></a><h2>Weekly Miniquizzes</h2>

A <span class="due">closed book</span> miniquiz, usually 15 minutes,
will be given in class most Mondays.  Miniquizzes count for a total
of <span class="meyer">5%</span> of the final grade.

<p>
Material to study for a miniquiz is well defined: a miniquiz will
basically consist of excerpts or small variations of problems assigned
the previous week, including class, pset, and online problems.  You
can prepare for a miniquiz simply by reviewing the posted problem
solutions for the previous week.  (You
are <span class="red">not</span> allowed to use a crib sheet during
miniquizzes.)
</p>

<p>
For miniquizzes, the grades are <span class="meyer">OK, NeedsWork,
UnConvincing</span>.  If you get an <span class="meyer">NW</span>
or <span class="meyer">UC</span>, you may email an appeal for upgrade
The email should include:
<ul>

  <li> a self-assessment of your miniquiz answers, indicating
    weaknesses you acknowledge (or deny) in comparison to the posted
    solution (in cases with no posted solution, you should also write
    a solution),</li>

  <li> a new miniquiz question that would be suitable for this
    miniquiz in a future term.</li>
</ul>
If you <span class="meyer">miss</span> a miniquiz, you are allowed to make it up using the same procedure. First you should write up your own solutions (without looking at the offical solutions) and then follow the same steps as above. In this case, you must also email your own solution.
<br>
Upgrades are not guaranteed but remain at the discretion of your
coach.  (We do guarantee that you will not be downgraded because of an
appeal, even if a mistake in your favor is uncovered.)  The bar for
upgrades will be set high enough to ensure that counting on appeals to
make up for being unprepared will not be a good strategy.

<a name="midterm"></a><h2>Midterm Exams</h2>

Three 80 minute midterm exams will be given in class on on
Wednesday, <span class="due">February
25</span>, <span class="due">March 18</span>,
and <span class="due">April 15</span>.  The midterm
exams <strong>each</strong> count for a total
of <span class="meyer">10%</span> of the final grade.

<p>
  Midterm questions will typically be variations of prior problems from
  class and psets, and the best way to prepare is to review on the
  published solutions to these problems.  The first exam covers all
  previous weeks' material; subsequent exams focus on the material after
  the previous exam.  The material on the Monday before midterms 2 &amp; 3
  will not be covered, but because of lost days to snow, induction will be
  covered by midterm 1.  A single two-sided crib sheet is allowed for each
  midterm.
</p>
<h2>Final Exam</h2>

There will be a three hour final exam during exam period on
 <span class="meyer">Thursday, May 21, 9AM</span> in 34-101.  This
exam is worth <span class="meyer">25%</span> of the final class grade.

<p>
The final exam will cover the entire subject with somewhat greater
emphasis on material from after Midterm 3.  Most exam questions will
be variants of problems assigned during the term (pset, class,
midterm, and online).  It may include a few questions which combine
topics that were originally covered separately.  A pair of two-sided
crib sheets (total: 4 sides) are allowed for the final.
</p>
<a name="grades"></a><h2>Grades</h2>

Grades for the class are based on the following weighting:

<h4></h4><table>
<tr><td>Class participation</td><td>25%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Online Feedback Problems: </td><td>05%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Problem Sets: </td><td>15%</td></tr>
<!--<tr><td>Miniquizzes: </td><td>05%</td></tr>-->
<tr><td>Midterm exams: </td><td>30%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Final: </td><td>25%</td></tr>
<!--<tr><td>Weekly Reading Comments: </td><td>2.5%</td></tr>-->
</table>
<p>
  The lowest problem set score and lowest <em>three (3)</em> class
session scores will not count in grade calculation.  This effectively
gives you <span class="meyer">a problem set and three class
sessions</span> you can miss without excuse or penalty.  You should
notify the staff in advance of an absence if possible, and briefly
indicate the reason.
</p>
<p>
  Think of the three absences as "personal" days which you may use for
  sick leave, professional conflicts like job interviews, or sleeping
  in.  Waivers and makeups for missed psets or absences will be
  considered only <strong>after the one pset or three allowed absence
  waivers are used up</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  The class is <strong>not</strong> graded on a curve.  In fact, MIT policy
  (Rules and Regulations of the Faculty, section 2.62) does not allow
  grading according to a fixed grade distribution.  Instead, students
  are assessed individually.  In particular, students who remain in
  class after Drop Date are not in jeopardy of seeing their grades
  change due to the change in class composition.
</p>

 While there is no curve, it is expected that 6.042J/18.062J will
  be "(A-/B+)-centered" with more than 10% unsatisfactory grades (D or
  F) unlikely.
