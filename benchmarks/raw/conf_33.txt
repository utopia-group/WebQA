<p>Financial Cryptography and Data Security is a major international
forum for research, advanced development, education, exploration, and
debate on information security with a specific focus on financial and
commercial systems.  Original works on all aspects of financial
security and privacy are solicited, from fundamental theory to
real-world deployments.  Submissions need not be exclusively concerned
with cryptography.  Systems security, economic or behavioral
perspectives, and interdisciplinary efforts are particularly
encouraged.</p>
<p>Financial Cryptography and Data Security has two submission tracks,
a <strong>blockchain track</strong> that serves as the premier venue
for cryptocurrency and blockchain research (subsuming the prior
BITCOIN workshop), and a <strong>traditional track</strong> focusing
on security and cryptography in all other financial and payment
systems.</p>
<p>Topics of particular interest for the <strong>traditional
track</strong> include all aspects of (non-blockchain) payment and
financial systems, in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access Control</li>
<li>Anonymity and Privacy</li>
<li>Applied Cryptography</li>
<li>Auctions and Incentive Design</li>
<li>Authentication, Identification, and Biometrics</li>
<li>Banking and Financial Services Security</li>
<li>Behavioral Aspects of Security and Privacy</li>
<li>Certification and Audits</li>
<li>Cloud Computing and Data Outsourcing Security</li>
<li>Contactless Payment and Ticketing Systems</li>
<li>Digital Rights Management</li>
<li>Economics of Security and Privacy</li>
<li>Electronic Commerce Security</li>
<li>Electronic Crime and Underground Markets</li>
<li>Fraud Detection and Management</li>
<li>Game Theory for Security and Privacy</li>
<li>Legal and Regulatory Issues</li>
<li>Phishing and Social Engineering</li>
<li>Reputation Systems</li>
<li>Smart Contracts and Financial Instruments</li>
<li>Smartcards, Secure Tokens, and Secure Hardware</li>
<li>Trust Management</li>
<li>Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) Security and Applications</li>
<li>Usability and Security</li>
<li>Voting Systems</li>
<li>Web Security</li>
</ul>
<p>Topics of particular interest for the <strong>blockchain
track</strong> include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applications Using or Built on Top of Bitcoin</li>
<li>The Bitcoin Protocol and Extensions</li>
<li>Blockchain Applications</li>
<li>Case Studies (e.g., of adoption, attacks, forks, scams, …)</li>
<li>Cryptocurrency Adoption and Transition Dynamics</li>
<li>Digital Cash and Payment Systems</li>
<li>Distributed Consensus Protocols</li>
<li>Distributed Ledgers</li>
<li>Economic and Monetary Aspects of Cryptocurrencies</li>
<li>Economics and/or Game Theoretic Analysis of Cryptocurrency Protocols</li>
<li>Forensics and Monitoring</li>
<li>Fraud Detection and Financial Crime Prevention</li>
<li>Legal, Ethical and Societal Aspects of (Decentralized) Virtual Currencies</li>
<li>Peer-to-Peer Networks</li>
<li>Permissioned and Permissionless Blockchains</li>
<li>Proof-of-work, -stake, -burn</li>
<li>Real-world Measurements and Metrics</li>
<li>Regulation and Law Enforcement</li>
<li>Relation of Cryptocurrencies to Other Payment Systems</li>
<li>Smart Contract Analysis and Tools</li>
<li>Transaction Graph Analysis</li>
<li>Usability and User Studies</li>
</ul>
<p>Papers from both tracks may be reviewed by the same program
committee and will be presented from Monday to Thursday of the
conference week, without parallel sessions to the extent possible.
The workshops, as in previous years, will be held in parallel to each
other on Friday.</p>

<h4 id="deadline">Randomized deadline</h4>
<p>Many security conferences, including this one in the past, have
claimed a firm deadline only to extend it by several days as the
deadline approached.  Keeping with the tradition started last year, we
will implement a randomized deadline in a verifiable way.</p>
<p><strong>All papers must be registered by Tue Sep 17, 2019.</strong>
This means the titles, authors, abstracts, topics, submission options,
conflicts, etc. (everything except the final PDF of the paper) must be
entered into the submission system by this date.  <strong>This date is
firm and will not be extended.</strong>
</p><p>On September 17, 2019, we will announce (in this space) a block
height on the Bitcoin blockchain that we expect to be found the
following day.</p>
<p style="background:yellow; border: 2px solid red; padding: 2px">The selected block height is <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/btc/block-height/595500" target="_blank"><b>595500</b></a>.</p>
<p>Once the block of that height is found and confirmed, let
the <em>last hex digit</em> of the hash of that block be <em>L</em>.
Then the FC20 paper submission deadline will be September
(20+ceil(sqrt(<em>L</em>))), 2019.  In table form:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" class="deadline">
<thead><tr><th><em>L</em></th><th>Paper submission deadline</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>0</td><td>Sep 20, 2019</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Sep 21, 2019</td></tr>
<tr><td>2, 3, 4</td><td>Sep 22, 2019</td></tr>
<tr><td>5, 6, 7, 8, 9</td><td>Sep 23, 2019</td></tr>
<tr><td>A, B, C, D, E, F</td><td>Sep 24, 2019</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>When the paper submission deadline has been determined in this way,
this page will be updated, and that deadline will
be <strong>firm</strong>.  The program chairs' interpretation of the
above algorithm is final.</p>
<p style="background:yellow; border: 2px solid red; padding: 2px">The FC20 <b>firm</b> submission deadline is <b>Mon Sep 23, 2019</b>.</p>
<p>If this is too complicated, you are welcome to submit a final PDF
any time before Sep 20, 2019, which is guaranteed to be before the
deadline.</p>
<h3 id="submission">Submission</h3>
<p>Submissions are sought in the following categories:<br/>
(i) regular papers (15 pages LNCS format excluding references and appendices),<br/>
(ii) short papers (8 pages LNCS format in total),<br/>
(iii) systematization of knowledge papers (20 pages LNCS format excluding references and appendices),<br/>
(iv) panel and workshop proposals (2 pages), and<br/>
(v) posters (1 page).</p>
<p>Papers must be formatted in standard LNCS format and submitted as
PDF files.  Submissions in other formats will be rejected.  All papers
must be submitted electronically according to the instructions and
forms found here and at the submission site.  For each accepted
paper/poster the conference requires at least one registration at the
general or academic rate, and paper authors must sign
the <a href="http://ifca.ai/documents/copyright.html">IFCA copyright
form</a> when submitting the final version.  Alternatively, individual
papers can be published as fully open access—the publisher
charges authors a fee for this (currently EUR 38 per page).</p>
<p><b>Original submissions:</b> Authors may submit only work that does
not substantially overlap with work that is currently submitted or has
been accepted for publication to any other peer-reviewed
conference/workshop with proceedings or a journal.  We consider double
submission serious research fraud and will treat it as such.  Note
that it is acceptable for papers to appear in non-peer-reviewed
formats (for example, as technical reports or in online archives such
as ePrint).  In case of doubt contact the program chairs for any
clarifications
at <a href="mailto:fc20chair@ifca.ai">fc20chair@ifca.ai</a>.</p>
<p><b>Research paper submission:</b> Paper submissions should be
uploaded through the <a href="https://submit20.ifca.ai/">conference
submission website</a>, where authors should also report any conflicts
with program committee members.  A conflict exists if an author has
the same affiliation as a committee member, has ever acted as their
PhD supervisor or been supervised by them, or if they have been
co-authors on a paper within the past two years.</p>
<p><b>Anonymous submission:</b> Regular and short research paper
submissions must be anonymized with no author names, affiliations,
acknowledgments, or obvious references.  Failure to properly anonymize
submitted papers is grounds for a desk rejection without review.  It
is acceptable (but by no means required) for submitted papers to be
published online in non-anonymous form (e.g., on authors' websites or
archives like ePrint or arXiv.org).  Program committee members will be
instructed not to actively seek to de-anonymize papers.</p>
<p><b>Panel, poster and workshop submission:</b> Poster submissions
and workshop/panel proposals should be sent by email to
<a href="mailto:fc20chair@ifca.ai">fc20chair@ifca.ai</a> and should
not be anonymized.</p>
<p><b>Re-submission to affiliated workshops:</b> Papers that are
submitted but ultimately not accepted to the main conference may be
considered for acceptance at one of the associated workshops.  If you
would like to take advantage of this, please indicate this preference
when submitting your paper.</p>
<h4 id="regular">Regular Research Papers</h4>
<p>Research papers should describe novel, previously unpublished
scientific contributions to the field, and they will be subject to
rigorous peer review.  Accepted submissions will be included in the
conference proceedings to be published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture
Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.  Submissions are limited to
15 pages in standard LNCS format excluding references and appendices.
A total page restriction may apply for the printed proceedings
version.  Committee members are not required to read the appendices,
so the full papers should be intelligible without them.</p>
<h4 id="short">Short Papers</h4>
<p>Short papers are also subject to peer review; however, the
intention is to encourage authors to introduce work in progress, novel
applications, and corporate/industrial experiences.  Short papers will
be evaluated with a focus on novelty and potential for sparking
participants' interest and future research avenues.  Short paper
submissions are limited to 8 pages in standard LNCS format in total.
The paper title for short papers must include the text "Short Paper:".
Accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings.
The authors of some submissions not accepted as regular research
papers may be offered the option of acceptance as a short paper.</p>
<h4 id="sok">Systematization of Knowledge Papers</h4>
<p>We also solicit Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers.  To be
suitable for publication, SoK articles must provide an added value
beyond a literature review, such as novel insights, identification of
research gaps, or challenges to commonly held assumptions.  SoK paper
submissions are limited to 20 pages in standard LNCS format excluding
references and appendices.  Accepted submissions will be included in
the conference proceedings.  A total page restriction may apply for
the printed proceedings version.  Committee members are not required
to read the appendices, so the full papers should be intelligible
without them.  The paper title for systematization of knowledge papers
must include the text "SoK:".</p>
<h4 id="panel">Panel Proposals</h4>
<p>We especially would like to encourage submissions of panel
proposals.  These should include a brief description of the panel
topics, as well as of the prospective panelists.  Accepted panel
sessions will be presented at the conference.  Please feel free to
contact us directly if you would like to further discuss the
suitability of a certain topic.  Panel submissions must not be
anonymous and should be up to 2 pages, sent
to <a href="mailto:fc20chair@ifca.ai">fc20chair@ifca.ai</a>.</p>
<h4 id="poster">Posters</h4>
<p>The poster session is the perfect venue to share a provocative
opinion, interesting established or preliminary work, or a cool idea
that will spark discussion.  Poster presenters will benefit from a
multi-hour session to discuss their work, get exposure, and receive
feedback from attendees.  Poster submissions should be a 1-page
abstract (in the same LNCS format) describing the poster.  Please keep
in mind that the poster deadline is later than the main paper
submission deadline.  Poster proposals must not be anonymous and
should be sent to the posters chair
at <a href="mailto:fc20chair@ifca.ai">fc20chair@ifca.ai</a>.</p>
<h4 id="workshop">Workshop Proposals</h4>
<p>Proposals for workshops to be held at FC20 are also solicited.  A
workshop can be a full day or half day in length.  Workshop proposals
should include: (i) a title; (ii) a call for papers; (iii) a brief
summary and justification, including how it would fit into the greater
FC scope; (iv) a (tentative) Program Committee and its Chair(s); (v)
one-paragraph biographies for key organizers; and (vi) the expected
(or previous, if the workshop has been held in previous years) number
of submissions, participants and acceptance rates.  Workshop proposals
must not be anonymous and should be sent
to <a href="mailto:fc20workshops@ifca.ai">fc20workshops@ifca.ai</a>.
<!-- Proposals received after the submission deadline will be considered on
a rolling basis for any remaining slots. --></p>
<h4 id="rump">The Rump Session</h4>
<p>FC20 will also include the popular "rump session" held on one of
the evenings in an informal, social atmosphere.  The rump session is a
program of short (5 minutes), informal presentations on works in
progress, off-the-cuff ideas, and any other matters pertinent to the
conference.  Any conference attendee is welcome to submit a
presentation to the Rump Session Chair (to be announced at the
conference).  This submission should consist of a talk title, the name
of the presenter, and, if desired, a very brief abstract.  Submissions
may be sent via e-mail, or submitted in person in the morning on the
day of the session.</p>
<!--
<h4>Best Paper Awards</h4>

<p>
Awards will be presented for the best overall paper, and outstanding
paper(s) that specifically address challenges in financial
cryptography, and financial systems, including
usability/interdisciplinary approaches.
</p>
-->
<h3 id="stipends">Student Stipends</h3>
<p>IFCA is seeking funding to continue its program of financial
support specifically for students attending FC, and students are
encouraged to submit work in anticipation that funding will be found.
Previous grants prioritized students presenting at the conference or
associated workshops and students fresh to the field, but all students
are encouraged to apply.  If you are interested in applying for
stipend support, please email the FC20 general chairs
at <a href="mailto:fc20general@ifca.ai?subject=student%20stipend">fc20general@ifca.ai</a>
with subject line "student stipend" and a letter of support from your
thesis supervisor or home institution confirming your student status
and stating that a stipend would help make it possible for you to
attend the conference.</p>
