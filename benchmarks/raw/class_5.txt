<h1>CS378: Practical Applications of Natural Language Processing</h1>
<h3>Syllabus for Spring 2019</h3>
</center>
<br/><br/>
<h3>Course Description</h3>
<p>
					Automatically extracting information from natural-language text is one
					of the great scientific challenges in AI, and it also offers
					significant practical and commercial benefits. This class will explore
					the state of the art in applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
					through a series of increasingly ambitious projects. Each project is inspired
					by real use cases, sometimes with datasets provided by local
					companies. For each project, we will read research publications and
					investigate algorithms and tools that might apply. 
                                    </p>

				<h3>Textbooks and Supplies</h3>
<p>
                                    Research papers and documentation for various NLP tools will be 
                                    distributed throughout the semester. We will extensively use the following three tools, so you might consider
				    investing in reference materials:
                                    </p><ul>
<li>Apache <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">SOLR</a>
</li><li>Stanford <a href="https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/">CoreNLP</a>
</li><li><a href="https://spacy.io">spaCy</a>
</li></ul>
                                    In particular, the first project will use Solr extensively, and that system might play a role in later projects, too.
				    Therefore, we recommend that you, or your group, invest in a reference book, such as "Solr In Action" by Grainger and Potter. 
				    

                                <h3>Pre-Requisites</h3>
<p>
				    Students are expected to have strong programming skills, especially in Python,
				    and to be proficient in using libraries, APIs, and development platforms like GitHub.
                                    Also, students are expected to have strong "team skills" to work in groups of about four.
				    Prior experience with AI, Machine Learning and NLP is valuable, but not required.
                                    </p>
<h3>Structure of the Class</h3>
<p>
				    The class will mirror an <i>advanced development group</i> in a forward-looking company that is trying to
				    extract actionable information from the increasing deluge of unstructured information that is critical to
				    its clients' operations. You will work with a team of about three others to quickly learn NLP concepts and
				    technologies, while building first-generation systems to meet the needs of clients who are paying the bills.
                                    </p><p>
				    Teams will be formed in a way that resembles the process used in companies. The process will ensure
				    that every team includes the diverse skills required for the projects, while leaving some room for
				    students to select teammates. Everyone is expected to contribute significantly to their team,
				    and there will be a process for you to anonymously grade the contributions of your colleagues.
				    </p><p>
				    An advanced-development team is continually learning. Everyone reads papers, experiments with
				    new things, and reports their discoveries to the group. So, that's one of the class requirements.
				    Everyone is required to give at least one 15-20 minute presentation sometime during the semester.
				    Respect your colleagues by delivering an informative, interesting and coherent presentation that
				    invites discussion. 


				</p><h3>Projects</h3>
<p>
				    This will be a <i>learning by doing</i> class. As we go, we'll read and discuss research papers to help with
				    the project at hand. Students will be expected to explore related work and to openly share their discoveries,
				    insights and challenges with the class. The projects might change during the semester, but here is the
				    current sequence:
                                    </p><ol>
<li><i>Information Retrieval.</i> Google owns Internet-scale, "open domain"
				      search. But, there are many opportunities to build
				      information-retrieval systems that perform better than Google for
				      searching a corpus of documents in a narrow domain, such as aircraft
				      maintenance or pediatric oncology. The project will use SOLR to ingest
				      and index documents, producing a simple IR system. We will attempt to
				      improve the system with NLP techniques, such as stemming and
				      lemmatizing, to improve the match between query terms and passages in
				      the corpus. The project will use word vectors to represent semantics,
				      so that the system is not limited to literal matches. We will assess
				      the effectiveness of these attempts to improve the simple system.
				      
				      </li><li><i>Named Entity Recognition and Parsing.</i> While the first project
				      focused on word-level constructs, this project aims to extract larger
				      structures from text. Named entities are words or phrases that refer, for example,
				      to a person, place, organization. The project will use parsers, such as
				      SpaCy, CoreNLP and possibly <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/openie.html">OpenIE</a>,
				      to extract relationships among the named entities to populate a structured database with useful information. 

				      </li><li><i>Question Answering.</i> Building on the lessons and results from the first two
				      projects, this one aims to create a system capable of answering a
				      question, expressed in English (not just keywords), by retrieving an appropriate - and
				      succinct - passage of text. The project will use techniques deployed in
				      IBM's Watson system to determine the Lexical Answer Type of candidate
				      answers, and to retrieve and rank candidates from the database
				      of named entities. 

				      </li><li><i>Extracting larger units of knowledge.</i> Each team of students will
				      design a project to study an NLP problem that requires new research on an
				      extraction task that is beyond the current state-of-the-art. Examples include: 
				        <ul>
<li>extracting rules from written descriptions of tax codes.  The Ernst &amp;
					  Young Tax Guide summarizes each nation's tax code. Much of this text
					  describes events that trigger taxation. The challenge is
					  to extract <i>if-then</i> rules, ideally in a representational form that can
					  be interpreted by machine, to infer, for example, a client's tax
					  liabilities.  
					  </li><li>extracting process models from textbook descriptions.
					  Science texts are rich with paragraph-length
					  descriptions of processes, such as the <i>water cycle</i>
					  or <i>RNA Transcription</i>.  Process descriptions typically include
					  multiple steps which are inter-related with temporal, spatial and causal relations.
					  The challenge is extracting these rich models,
					  ideally in a representational form that can be simulated by machine, to
					  infer, for example, the consequences of varying the inputs to the
					  process.
					</li></ul>
</li></ol>
<h3>Grading</h3>
<p>
                                    The final course grade will be determined by these factors:
				    </p><ul>
<li> Grades on each of 4 team projects (15% per project, 60% in total)
				       </li><li> Your teammates' assessment of your contributions to each of the 4 projects
				            (5% per project, 20% in total)
				       </li><li> Your class presentation (10%)
				       </li><li> Class attendance and participation (10%). Attendance is required, although up to 3
				            absences will be excused
                                    </li></ul>
<h3>Plans May Change</h3>
				    This syllabus lays out my best plan for making the class rewarding, challenging and doable.
				    But, this class has not been taught previously and I am new to the topic, so I might need to
				    adjust the plan during the semester.
